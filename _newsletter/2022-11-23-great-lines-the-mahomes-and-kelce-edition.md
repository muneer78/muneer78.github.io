It's now the second time I've sent a Thanksgiving newsletter. This officially makes this newsletter the longest creative endeavor I've ever engaged in.

First, don't ever hate on Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce:

Second, here's a piece of advice I gave my nephews when they were younger:

> My sister in law was once discussing threesomes at a family dinner. I told my 2 teen nephews, "Don't ever do that. You never want to disappoint 2 women when you can get away with disappointing just 1."

[Third](https://www.theroot.com/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-barbershop-1822521573), don't think that the guys at a black barbershop are as nice and respectful as they appear:

> If you are a person who happens to be a woman, and you’ve ever entered a barbershop, you might have left impressed by their politeness and chivalry. Do not be fooled by this. Because, the moment you left the shop — like, literally, one second after you left — it turned right back into an 8th boys’ locker room. And, even if your butt is basically just an extension of your back, it was noted and mentioned. Sometimes in depth. And sometimes, um, not in depth. (i.e.; “Dat ass, though?!?!”)
