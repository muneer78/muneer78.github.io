[First](https://www.jacksonville.com/obituaries/pfla0245589), this obituary is very honest about the departed:

> His love was abundant when it came to himself, but for his children it was limited.

[Second](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-bachelorette-recap-season-19-episode-3-week-three.html), this line from a Bachelorette recap describes why a lot of people may not be introspective:

> ... the only thing left to do is stare into the abyss that is our own soul and find ourselves wanting.

[Third](https://basenotes.com/reviews/26227595), a review on a cologne forum has written some of the most evocative reviews I've ever read. They're all worth looking at, but here's a sample:

> You're a rabbit. You live in a dead garden. Your entire diet consists of unremarkable weeds, poison ivy/oak/sumac, and the occasional poisonous flower blossom. But, this isn't just any garden, because its owner decided to plant a bunch of cucumbers this year. So, you're a rabbit. You live in a mostly dead garden. Your entire diet consists of raw cucumbers, unremarkable weeds, poison ivy/oak/sumac, and the occasional poisonous flower blossom. The best part is that every so often you get to munch on all of these things after they've been spritzed with an insecticide. Santal 33 by Le Labo.
