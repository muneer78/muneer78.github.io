I loved the way different members of the British aristocracy were described in [this article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/28/philby):

> Sir Stewart Menzies, who, we are told, "rode to hounds, mixed with royalty, never missed a day at Ascot, drank a great deal, and kept his secrets buttoned up behind a small, fierce mustache. He preferred women to men and horses to both. 

> According to Macintyre, the elder Elliott "loathed entertainment, which gave him indigestion, despised all forms of heating as 'effete,' and believed that 'when dealing with foreigners the best plan was to shout at them in English.'
