[First](https://www.vulture.com/article/bachelor-in-paradise-season-8-premiere-recap-episode-1.html), a great quote about Jesse Palmer as the new host of Bachelor in Paradise:

> "...let me be the first to say that I think Jesse will actually succeed as a Paradise host. He’s at his best when he’s a little disgusted and confused by what’s happening around him.

[Second](https://ez.substack.com/p/the-work-from-home-future-is-destroying), I've begun reading Ed Zitron's newsletter. He's one of the few people who's saying the quiet things out loud about the way our employers really see their employees. Here are some certified anti-work bangers:

> At its purest, it is hiring people for vanity’s sake - you’re not hiring because you want to make more money, you’re hiring because you want to do less and own people.

> Bosses love the idea that they capture your time and part of your soul with work - you are theirs, “full-time.” Their intention was not just to hire you for a task within an organization - it was to trap you and your production in the office, and on some level divorce you from your labor while extracting it, in exchange for the “protection” of full-time work that rarely if ever defends you from layoffs or firings, especially in at-will employment states. That’s why Shayne’s statement is so powerful - it is not about work, it is about ownership.

> You can’t monopolize someone’s time when you can’t trap them and act as a hall monitor over their every action, and so they want you back in the office. They deep down know you’re not working all 8 hours of the day at your work station, but they know that you know that they could walk behind you at any time and see that you’re doing something else. They don’t want to make the office a place where things actually get done, because that’s not the point to them - the point is that they own you.
