When this movie first came out, my mom recorded it. She and my two sisters then made a habit of watching it together every afternoon (this was in the summer) for the next month or so. I began locking myself in my room until my dad got home, as it seemed that such a movie could only put me, the only boy in the house, in danger.

I was scared mainly because my mom hated my dad, and as an extension, me. She would often speak badly of him, and referred to a desire to murder him in a graveyard. This movie, with Angela Bower going crazy on Peter Strauss, could only amplify this feeling.
