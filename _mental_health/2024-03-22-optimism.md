I think people always highlight what they've done well. There are tons of times I feel like I got outfoxed.

But, the thing that keeps me optimistic in the face of any struggle is that I've made it this far, and outlasted a lot of the people who got over on me.

As long as you have that inner strength, which you do possess, you'll do fine overall.
