My friend told us he's going to have to go camping with his son's scout troop. I said he needs to do the following:

Man, you need to take your own tent over there. Set it up like a Bedouin king. Lined with the finest furs, manservants and wenches. Go all out and capture some of the other children and have them bring out each dinner course. 

Send over your vizier with the Royal assent for s’mores time.
