The secretary at the law firm I worked at in independence had 3 kids, 13,9 and 2. 

Left the 13 year old in charge for the weekend. She partied with lawyers at a seminar at Tan tar a, where she proceeded to take topless pics with several of them in Party Cove. 

She then got them developed at a CVS. I only knew this because she was handing me the pics to look at and some of them were not for my eyes.

She also went to a club called Whiskey Tango every weekend. Mothering at its finest.
