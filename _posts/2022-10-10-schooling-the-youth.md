I was banned from a friend's house for a few years because of an incident involving his son, who was like 6 at the time. 

I was playing basketball with him. As his wife was bringing drinks out for us, I blocked the kid's shot, swatted it down the street and yelled, "DON'T EVER BRING THAT WEAK S**T AROUND HERE!!!" right in his face.
