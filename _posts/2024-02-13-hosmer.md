Back in the day, my pal Steve was driving through downtown at night. He saw a billboard whose lights were partially broken. 

What he did see were the words "Dinner with Hos for Father's Day." Had the billboard been lit properly, he would have seen it was a dinner with Eric Hosmer. 

Instead, he thought it was a dinner with ho's.
