I read a biography of Charles de Gaulle. Even though I hate France, I really admire him.

- After WWII, there were like 13 governments in 15 years. The Parliament asked de Gaulle to come back because the country was close to civil war. 
- He said he'd only do so if he wasn't subject to any elections and was allowed to rewrite the French Constitution. He wanted to ensure that the conditions that led to all the instability was able to be solved.
- He took power in 1958, did what he said he would, and resigned in 1969.
