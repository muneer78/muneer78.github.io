I’ve recently been watching a lot of the original “Head of the Class” series on HBO Max.  This type of nostalgia has been very prevalent in my life recently.

Over the past 3 months, I indulged in a very self reflective exercise. I found all of the links I’ve felt were worth saving, scattered all across various online repositories. I got all of the links together, tagged them with their subject, and organized them in the way I’d always dreamed of. It gave me a small bit of control in an uncontrollable time. When all was said and done, I had almost 29,500 links catalogued.

For those who are interested, you can see almost all of the links here. Feel free to use it as a way to find interesting stuff to read. If the link is broken, just enter it into the Internet Archive.

And now, on to the Great Lines.

> Do  you think I care about losing you as a follower? I do not. Not one bit.  I will actively block you on Instagram if I know you’re a Trump  supporter. You unfollowing me doesn’t hurt me in any way. I literally —  in the true sense of the word — won’t notice you are gone.

> You can’t support Trump and also be a decent human being. You can’t support Trump and earn my respect.


[Third](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-wile-e-coyote-explains-the-world-1752248034), a classic line from an essay about the classic comics of Wile E. Coyote:

> …your  mind is a baffling supercomputer nevertheless hopelessly inadequate to  the task of understanding the full terrible complexity of the world  around you.g in his own nest. But he also shit in our  nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a  brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States,  by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the  heart of the American Dream.
