There is a very concerning storyline I'm tracking about the Pakistan cricket coach after the World Cup loss to the USA: 

- Pakistan lost to the US in the initial stages of the tournament. That's like the Royals losing to the lowest level minor league team out there. 
- As a result, they didn't make it to the semifinals, which was the minimum expectation.
- The last time a loss of this magnitude occurred, in 2007, the national team's coach died a few weeks later under very murky circumstances. It's widely believed he was poisoned.
- If I was the coach, I'd hire 24 hour security, a food taster, and see if I could lease the Popemobile.
