These are some great lines from Roger Ebert's book, I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie:

> In which we determine how werewolves are made, how they are killed, and how they spread their wolfiness.

****

> Here is an actress meant to play a woman who is in love, and she seems subtly uncomfortable with that fate.
                
****

> ...he finds himself overtaken by a vague discontent.
                
****

> Blake befriends a hapless flower girl, and is invited to her room for an encounter between innocence and experience.

****             

> It could not be more damaging to the career of Andrew Dice Clay if it had been made as a documentary by someone who hated him.

****

> ...a screenplay cleverly designed to obscure their strengths while showcasing their weaknesses.
                
****

> ...a ghoulish retailer of human misery.
                
***                

> The Jackal strikes me as the kind of overachiever who, assigned to kill a mosquito, would purchase contraband insecticides from Iraq and bring them into the United States by hot-air balloon, distilling his drinking water from clouds and shooting birds for food.
