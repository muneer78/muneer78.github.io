I stopped watching Lost in the middle of Season 4, but then decided I'd watch the finale. I began reading the episode recaps, and became angrier and angrier as I went on. In the end, I decided it wouldn't be good for my mental health and the structural integrity of my TV to watch.

The show runners openly admitted that they had no idea in the beginning what they were writing because they expected to be cancelled.
