Any of you ever just stay social media friends with someone because they post all their drama and it's the type of train wreck you can't look away from?

Well, this dude Mike had a Juggalo wedding. They were both in full Juggalo makeup and in the usual wedding attire.

Before, he'd post all sorts of passive aggressive stuff about no one wanting to give him a ride to go get groceries (he'd lost his license because of a DUI), all the issues he was having finding a stable place to stay (he was never homeless, just moved a lot), etc. 

He goes radio silent for like 7 months, and when he came back, his Juggalette was nowhere to be seen. Instead, he was now with a very straight edge lady. I want the story of how his Juggalo marriage collapsed, but not enough to talk to him.
