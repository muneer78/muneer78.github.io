This is an untrue, but hilarious story about Yusuf Dikec, the shooting gold medalist from Turkey:

> "... he was an ex-mechanic who became a world-renowned shooter after a bitter divorce. The picture showed Dikec in his full glory with the caption, “Sharon, if you’re watching this, I want my dog back."
