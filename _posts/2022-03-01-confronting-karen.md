Karen and her family came in without masks and then asked if the restaurant had masks for them.

The manager said no. So the Karen's family starts pulling their shirts up over their mouths, as if that would meet the mask mandate rules in Douglas County.

The manager reiterated that the mask mandate was a law.

The Karen then huffed and said, "Ugh, so we're just not going to eat out tonight?? Is that what you're telling me?"

That's when I stepped on the scene. I glared at the Karen and said, "You can buy a mask almost anywhere. Including the Office Depot next door." She looked at some of the other people in line for support. Everyone looked away.

I then said, "You will not be dining here tonight unless you get masks."

The Karen got deflated and left with her husband and kids.
