One positive bit of news about The Devil: She was seeing a dude for a year. He broke up with her the week of her surgery. I am happy when bad people are sad.

Also, my pal who also worked for The Devil reminded me of this: The Devil was apparently always complaining about how hard it was to find men to date. Another thing she'd always harp on is that she reads every email she gets by the end of the day.

Once I said maybe she could find a guy if she didn't spend all that time reading work messages. My pal said, "I don't think her emails are the main thing keeping her single."
