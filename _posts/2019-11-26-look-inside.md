First, from the ever wise [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](https://bookshop.org/books/meditations-a-new-translation-7be5ded9-87a9-4056-af72-d6c917125a29/9780812968255). I've linked to the translation I think is the best.

> When you face someone’s insults, hatred, whatever … look at his soul. Get inside him. Look at what sort of person he is. You’ll find you don’t need to strain to impress him.
