[First](https://deadspin.com/how-long-can-you-wear-championship-gear-1788695585), this is how I feel whenever I see a bumper sticker:

> Given the existence of car magnets and window clings, anyone who rocks a bumper sticker is a person of limited intellectual means.

[Second](https://deadspin.com/snackbots-astrobating-and-magic-condiment-fingers-5489446), this line describes how I want to feel all the time:

> Sometimes things get heated and I have to stand up to a charlatan with a spontaneous but devastating career-ending critique like the guy who took out Joe McCarthy at the army communism hearings.

[Third](https://headstuff.org/entertainment/film/mentertainments-the-grind-was-important-to-me-heres-why-i-want-it-back/), when I was in high school, I was a huge fan of MTV's The Grind. I will not pretend my motions were pure or that I was a huge fan of '90s urban dance. I was a teenage boy with limited access to the things I wanted to see the most. But, looking back on it, there was a certain vibe on The Grind that I see now in the sober light of remembrance:

> No Beavis and Butthead requiring the viewer to embrace idiocy as a kind of cynicism toward an incomprehensible world.
