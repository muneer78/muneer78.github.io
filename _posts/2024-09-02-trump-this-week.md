[Finally, the Democrats Have Found Trump’s Achilles’ Heel: Ridicule Him](https://thenewrepublic.substack.com/p/finally-the-democrats-have-found):

> ... it must drive Trump nuts, and when he goes nuts, he says especially nutty things

> ... it’s arguably more persuasive to swing voters than calling Trump a fascist. Trump is a fascist, make no mistake. But he’s also ridiculous. Mocking him over his Hannibal Lecter obsession will stick in apolitical people’s minds far more strongly than warning about his plans to wreck the Justice Department, and in its way, it’s just as disqualifying.

> Sustained ridicule has the potential to reinforce the downward spiral Trump is now in.

> Ridicule makes him weaker. Ridicule makes him small. Ridicule makes him desperate. He’ll try to respond with ridicule of his own, but he is not a clever man. He’s a stupid man. He has no wit. He has no sense of mischief. He doesn’t read. He doesn’t think beyond first reactions.

[Stray Thoughts On Patriotism](https://bad-faith-times.ghost.io/stray-thoughts-on-patriotism/):

> Patriotism is the last vestige of a scoundrel.

> The worst, most shameless scoundrels in American political history have expertly wielded the sledgehammer of patriotism against fellow citizens who would dare question their aims. They have intentionally and with great gusto turned important policy discussions into food fights about who has greater love for their country.

[How Biden’s Court Reform Proposals Could Work—if the Court Would Let Them | The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/what-does-bidens-court-reform-proposal-actually-propose/):

> The Trump court has been the most ethically compromised court in American history—based, at least, on the receipts we have available. Justice Thomas has taken more undisclosed free vacations than an Instagram model; his wife supported the January 6 insurrection. Justice Alito also likes to take free jet vacations without revealing who’s paid for his ticket; his wife cannot stay off the flagpole. Justice Gorsuch sold some of his property to the head of one of the biggest law firms in the country the moment he was elevated to the court. Kavanaugh is an alleged predator whose debts magically disappeared when he was nominated to the bench.

> Why would Republicans be against holding presidents liable for crimes—unless they like presidents who commit crimes?
