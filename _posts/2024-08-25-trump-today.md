In the least surprising news to date, Trump is lazy, undisciplined, and complaining about how unfair this election is. When him and his supporters talk about "easily triggered liberal snowflakes", it's a whole of projection.

[Trump allies try to energize him as he struggles to adapt to Harris - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/24/trump-energy-campaign-harris/):

> Yet he seems to be phoning it in, running a remarkably low-energy, undisciplined campaign,” said Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former White House spokeswoman...

> Asked about the perception that the change in Democratic candidates had thrown him off, Trump responded: “No, I think we’re doing great.” He proceeded to complain about how “unfair” the change was.

> “Donald Trump immediately melted down and hasn’t recovered since,” Harris-Walz spokeswoman Sarafina Chitika said. “Voters are watching an unhinged and unserious man rant on Truth Social, rave on Fox News and hold bizarre rallies where he rambles for hours about his own problems and throws out strange and dangerous ideas.”

> Across hundreds of name-drops, DNC convention speakers described Trump as a narcissist, a criminal, a charlatan, a race-baiter and more in searing speeches suggesting he remains the unifying target of the Democratic Party.
>
> Most of his allies offered little defense of his character.

What's he going to reset it to? Not being a racist, not being a liar, and being a decent human?

[Trump tries to reset his campaign after brutal month - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/24/trump-campaign-reset-harris-00176259):

> Privately, Trump has suggested he understands that he could lose in November if he does not dramatically change his approach to the race, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking who was granted anonymity to discuss the situation.

Color me shocked. People don't want to go backwards socially. We need to shame and humiliate all the culturally regressive extremists who have taken over the GOP.

Don't even get me started on Moms For Liberty. They want to enforce purity culture and anti-LGBTQ views while one of their founders is having FFM threesomes.

[Are Republicans losing the culture wars? - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/24/republicans-culture-war-races-00176166):

> School board candidates backed by Moms for Liberty, a conservative vanguard whose members popularized restrictions on classroom library books, are losing elections in Florida and some swing states. Republican leaders who rallied against critical race theory and LGBTQ+ issues recently faced recalls in red pockets of California.

> Conservative-leaning school board candidates backed by Moms for Liberty and a key supporter, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, fell this week in several races across the state. Moms for Liberty’s endorsees also struggled in 2023 school board elections, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, particularly in suburban areas.

> Republican-backed candidates made inroads in conservative pockets of California in 2022, but their progress has since eroded. In just the last year, six conservatives have been recalled, eliminating four GOP-endorsed school board majorities.

['Very unpopular': Editor of conservative outlet admits 'weak' Trump is 'definitely nuts'](https://www.alternet.org/conservative-outlet-trump/):

> Wright noted that throughout Trump's time in the White House, he "won by a razor's edge" in 2016, never enjoyed more than 49% support in public approval ratings and 'yet has carried on as though he was given a huge national mandate and enjoys major popular support when there’s zero evidence for that proposition.'

> 'He’s losing because he’s a weak, unpopular, undisciplined candidate running at the head of a weak, minority electoral coalition. That’s the truth, whether anyone wants to hear it or not.'

[Is Trump OK? Unhinged reaction to rise of Harris worries supporters](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/donald-trump-mental-fitness-campaign): 

> Since Harris assumed the mantle of the presumptive Democratic candidate, Trump has claimed to be better-looking than the vice-president, questioned whether she is really Black and attacked her laugh as that of 'a lunatic'.

> Melania’s reaction to her husband’s implicit claim that he is better-looking than his wife is not known.

> [Trump] told reporters that he was “very angry” at Harris for calling him weird and was “entitled to personal attacks”.

> When the focus was on Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said every presidential candidate should be required to take a cognitive test. Pressed this week by CBS News on whether he has done so himself, Trump claimed to have recently had a “perfect score” on two cognitive tests.
>
> “I got everything right. And one of the doctors said, ‘I’ve never seen that before, where you get everything right,’” he said.

The religious people who worship Trump would know they're repeating the story of the golden calf if they ever bothered to read the Bible.

[Trump TV Hosts At Rally Claim Bible Proves God Saved Trump](https://www.mediaite.com/news/god-was-in-this-trump-tv-hosts-claim-bible-proves-god-saved-trump-in-rant-about-leviticus-and-pig-blood/):

> The duo of Bobby McNeily and Megan Kohler spent the hours before the rally bantering through hours of pro-Trump commentary, including multiple assertions that God saved Trump from being assassinated — a premise that Trump himself has embraced.

> MEGAN KOHLER: Yeah. If anyone was ever doubting that there was divine intervention, if you look at the entire sequence of events and how it all played out, God was in this! God protected President Trump, and he’s going to continue to work through this movement.

[Trump can't shake ties to Project 2025—and it's driving him nuts](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/8/23/2265347/-Trump-can-t-shake-ties-to-Project-2025-and-it-s-driving-him-nuts):

> The denial is in bright blue and red letters: “Straight from Trump’s Platform,” it says. “NOT PROJECT 2025, WHICH TRUMP DIDN’T WRITE AND DOES NOT SUPPORT.”

> ... it’s hilariously ironic that the more he insists it has nothing to do with him, the deeper journalists dig—the Streisand Effect in action. Trump isn’t credible on just about anything, but on this one, he’s lost the battle. Fox News might indulge his repeated disavowals, but it won’t work: Trump and Project 2025 have become inextricably linked.

Anyone who says the GOP isn't racist is stupid or a liar.

[GOP group claims Kamala Harris is ineligible to be president due to Dred Scott decision](https://www.alternet.org/kamala-harris-dred-scott/):

> In an official resolution, the National Federation of Republican Assemblies (NFRA) – a 90 year-old GOP-aligned organization that counted former President Ronald Reagan among its membership — took the position that Harris should not be allowed to hold the office of president, citing several "precedent-setting U.S. Supreme Court cases." Among the six cases the NFRA cited was the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision of 1857, which is regarded as one of the worst SCOTUS decisions of all time, if not the worst ever.

> The resolution — which attorney Andrew Fleischman posted to the social media platform Bluesky — cited Article II, Section 1, Paragraph 5 of the Constitution, which pertains to only natural-born U.S. citizens being eligible to serve as president. The NFRA argued that the phrase "natural born citizen" is defined as "a person born on American soil of parents who are both citizens of the United States at the time of the child's birth."

> "All of these cases except Perkins v. Elg have been abrogated or are completely unrelated," one user wrote. "Dredd[sic] Scott was overturned entirely by the 14th and its text cannot be meaningfully cited for any reason whatsof—ingever."

[Maggie Haberman Says Trump ‘Clearly Jarred’ by Harris’s Rise](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/maggie-haberman-says-trump-clearly-jarred-by-harriss-rapid-rise-he-is-not-in-command-of-himself/):

> “Look, he’s very reactive in all things when he is not in command,” Haberman replied. “And we have seen this over the course of the last nine years that he’s been in politics or in the political arena. He is clearly jarred by her. 

> “So, both of the Obamas’ speeches got under his skin,” Haberman replied. “He is very reactive to both of them. We have seen that since 2011 when Trump spread the lie that President Obama was possibly born in Kenya and therefore illegitimate to be president. I think you’re going to see more of this.”
