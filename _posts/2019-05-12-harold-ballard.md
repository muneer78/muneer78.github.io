The more I read through this article about Harold Ballard, the more I'm struck by how the rich can do whatever they want.

[A History of Harold Ballard's Villainy | Five Minutes For Fighting](http://www.fiveminutesforfighting.com/2012/09/a-history-of-harold-ballards-villainy.html):

> In The Game, Ken Dryden wrote that Ballard seemed 'like [a] wrestling villain who touches the audience to make his next villainy seem worse.'

> Neilson was hired back a few days later after the players protested to Ballard, who relented, only to insist that Neilson wear a paper bag over his head for his first game back as a coach.
