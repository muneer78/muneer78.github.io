Mookie Wilson, when he was playing for the New York Mets, had an interesting way of looking at batting slumps:

I love reading Naval Ravikant and listening to his podcast appearances. 

[How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1002103360646823936.html):

> Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.

Roger Ebert was always at his best when he didn't like a movie, like [1980's "Spit on Your Grave"](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-spit-on-your-grave-1980):

> I wanted to turn to the man near me and tell him his remarks were disgusting, but I did not. To hold his opinions at his age, he must already have suffered a fundamental loss of decent human feelings. I would have liked to talk with the woman in the back row, the one with the feminist solidarity for the movie’s heroine. I wanted to ask if she’d been appalled by the movie’s hour of rape scenes. As it was, at the film’s end I walked out of the theater quickly, feeling unclean, ashamed, and depressed. This movie is an expression of the most diseased and perverted darker human natures. Because it is made artlessly, it flaunts its motives: There is no reason to see this movie except to be entertained by the sight of sadism and suffering.
