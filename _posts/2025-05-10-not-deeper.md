From Amanda Marcotte's newsletter:

> For instance, Trump filibustered on Tuesday by saying, “Think of us as a super luxury store” where “we're going to give you a very good price, we're going to make very good deals, and in some cases, we'll adjust.” CNBC reporter Megan Cassella interpreted this by posting, “By naming a ‘price’ for countries to pay to ‘shop’ in the US, it appears he wants some tariff to remain in place, and possibly with everyone.”

> She admitted this is “confusing,” but she still gave this idiocy too much credit. The likelier explanation is that President Drink Bleach enjoys the image of himself hashing out the price of oil and Barbie dolls. He likes to talk about this fantasy, because it’s a lot easier than trying to understand how international trade works. He’s always been dumb, and his brain is rotting from age and being surrounded only by sycophants. It’s not deeper than that.
