[The American Nightmare Is A Rerun](https://defector.com/the-american-nightmare-is-a-rerun):

> Young voters do not look at our politics and see any good guys," a pollster told Semafor in May. "They see a dying empire led by bad people."

> I am tired of hearing that the other side is worse. They are; I already know this; that is not enough. I am tired of watching the people who are supposed to represent us roll over in front of Republicans every time they have the majority and then hesitate or capitulate when the Republicans refuse to do the same. I want the fucking moon to fall. I want something to change. I want the future to be different than the past, and I want that to start now.
