[Third](https://www.grunge.com/127517/the-most-brutal-entertainment-reviews-of-all-time/), these are a couple of lines from a list of the most brutal entertainment reviews of all time:

> "calling Timberlake an "abjectly poor" lyricist prone to dropping clunkers that "engender the same mix of emotions you'd confront upon walking in on your parents having sex.""

> "[He] raps like his bars are transcribed on the insides of fortune cookies that he must break open individually."
