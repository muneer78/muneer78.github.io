I think that if a person is hyper religious, then they've got dark impulses that they're trying to keep at bay through faith. They need an external control on their behavior because they don't feel like they can totally control themselves. These folks then think the whole world is just like them, and thus they try to pass all types of oppressive legislation because they think you and I are just like them.

Like Usama was really anti LGBTQ, even though his dad is gay. He wouldn't let his daughters hang out alone with his dad because then they might become gay too. But, all of us in the friend group have a suspicion that he wants to be with a dude but can't bring himself to do it. UBK is also very Catholic. So he has to use god to control himself.
