In 2019, I felt forced to work almost 80 hours a week for 8 months to get a new workflow system launched. 

I had a vacation scheduled in May, and my coworker said she could get the director to make me cancel the trip because they couldnâ€™t afford to have me not working. I told Jessicca that I was going to quit if that ultimatum was made. 

Sad part is that I was really good friends with the coworker. Some of the stuff she did during that project created a permanent gulf between us. I could never fully trust her again.
never fully trust her again.
