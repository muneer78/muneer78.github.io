**English teacher**: What do you think of as the American Dream?

**Me**: To live in a mansion with Benzes.

**English Teacher**: Your American Dream involves owning a foreign car? Wouldn't an American car be more appropriate?

**Me**: None of my dreams involve waiting on the side of the highway for a tow truck.
