title: Foreclosure

I got a call from a dude whose house was going to get foreclosed on. He had gotten a loan and bought a house. He did not have a job or any discernible source of income at any time during this process. He just told the bank he had a salary and they took his word for it

He wanted to save his house even though he'd gone into default when he missed the first mortgage payment.

When I asked him what he planned to do in order to make money to actually pay for the house, he couldn't tell me.
