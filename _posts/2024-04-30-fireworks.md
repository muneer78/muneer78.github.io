title: "Why Wouldn't We Be Brothers?"
---

Back in the day, I was setting off fireworks with a pal. I was probably 13 or so. 

Cop gets there and asks where my parents are, so I told them this white kid was my brother. Cop looked at me sideways and I act all indignant and say, "And why wouldn't he be my brother?? Why officer??" 

I thought that dude was going to poop his pants right there.
