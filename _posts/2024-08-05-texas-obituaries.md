People in the South [keeo it real times](https://hamletthedane.tumblr.com/post/740066648383422465/okay-i-used-to-review-texas-obituaries-for-a):

> I used to review Texas obituaries for a living and these are some of my favorite lines describing people who were apparently awful during their lifetimes:

> “A man of a distinct and unmatched personality” (divorced four times, hated by the entire town of Caldwell, Texas)

> “Many remember him most fondly as a child” (died in a meth lab explosion)

> “Her family hopes that Christ may finally guide her, and she may at last find peace” (For an 80yo woman. I never got the full story on this one, but it’s incredible)

> “He has gone now to see the fruits of his life” (man in question had assaulted and murdered two people, and was given the death penalty)

> Very common - “A man whom everybody in town knew and few forgot”

> “A man who read the scriptures and taught his children how to be strong” (a Christian fundamentalist arrested three times for violent family battery)

> “He was familiar with God”

> “In eternity, she will receive at last what she deserves”

> And my favorite - “She was a strong-willed woman who knew the value of manipulating a good deal. Her family believes she is now arguing with St. Peter to slip her the keys to the gate while Archangel Michael isn’t looking.” (Woman in question was vehemently hated by her entire family bc she had sued them multiple times)
