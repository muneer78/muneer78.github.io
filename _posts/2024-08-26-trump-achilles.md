[Finally, the Democrats Have Found Trump’s Achilles’ Heel: Ridicule Him](https://thenewrepublic.substack.com/p/finally-the-democrats-have-found):

> ... it must drive Trump nuts, and when he goes nuts, he says especially nutty things

> ... it’s arguably more persuasive to swing voters than calling Trump a fascist. Trump is a fascist, make no mistake. But he’s also ridiculous. Mocking him over his Hannibal Lecter obsession will stick in apolitical people’s minds far more strongly than warning about his plans to wreck the Justice Department, and in its way, it’s just as disqualifying.

> Sustained ridicule has the potential to reinforce the downward spiral Trump is now in.

> Ridicule makes him weaker. Ridicule makes him small. Ridicule makes him desperate. He’ll try to respond with ridicule of his own, but he is not a clever man. He’s a stupid man. He has no wit. He has no sense of mischief. He doesn’t read. He doesn’t think beyond first reactions.
