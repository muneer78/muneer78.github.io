The Democrats are a center right party. They abandoned being progressive when Jimmy Carter got smoked by Ronald Reagan in 1980. Bill Clinton put forth many policies that were conservative, like welfare reform and the amendment defining marriage as being between a man and woman. Same thing with Obama. Biden is the most progressive president we've had in decades.  

I read a book right after the 2016 election by Thomas Frank called Listen, Liberal which opened my eyes to these facts about the Dems. Great read if you're interested.

This graphic is solid at representing the shift of the GOP over the past 3 elections:
