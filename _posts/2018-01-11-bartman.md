I loved [this story](https://sports.theonion.com/steve-bartman-you-must-kill-me-to-break-the-cubs-cur-1819578352) from the Onion before the Cubs broke their curse:

> I must be killed by a dagger, clutched in the hand of a true Cubs fan, plunged directly into my heart, and only then can the Cubs win a World Series title.
