[Missouri MAGA Mommies Didn’t Vote For Trump To Deport This One Immigrant They Like!](https://evanhurst.substack.com/p/missouri-maga-mommies-didnt-vote):

> The New York Times is out with what may become a new kind of Cletus Safari, where instead of visiting diners to find out what makes Trump voters so dang special, mainstream journalists venture into the sticks to meet Trump voters who just can’t believe the leopards are eating their faces or the faces of people they love. They voted for the leopards to eat other people’s faces, you guys. 

> A white conservative Christian American man’s brain sure is a mighty sick place to be. 
 
> He voted for Trump’s leopards to eat other migrants’ faces. You know, the bad ones. Not the exceptions to the rule like Maurilio! _Our_ Maurilio! Good old Maurilio, who helps people, and is not a gang member and rapist like all the others! He didn’t want Trump to hurt _Maurilio!_

> Trump ICE meatsack Tom Homan, the stupid ass who looks like he became a middle school P.E. teacher for all the wrong reasons, was thrilled to share on Fox News how much more Gestapo-ing he’s about to do, for his lord and savior Donald Fucking Trump. 
 
> I don’t want us mollycoddling these fucking asshole MAGA Americans who have themselves convinced they’re not bigots _

> Those are the ones to whom we need to say, _yes, you bigoted motherfucker, this is EXACTLY what you voted for, and if you ever wish to atone for that on Earth before God dropkicks you into the fiery depths of hell, then it’s time to rip off the Band-Aid and confess what you do every time you enter a voting booth.__
