The Dems need to stop clinging to some stupid set of unwritten rules about civility while the GOP doesn’t give a crap about any of that stuff.

I want a bulldog who gives Trump nicknames, laughs in his face and calls him a business failure, and is so relentless in highlighting JD Vance’s hypocrisy that he curls up in the fetal position. During the debate, I want her to make Trump fall down and cry like the woman in the Life Alert commercials.

Would also love some jokes about Vance wearing eye liner. Dude looks like David Bowie in the 80s.
