Humans have been terrible to each other since the dawn of time. It's one of the things we do best.

The real villains here are the Western European countries. If they hadn't had WWI, then
- Germany wouldn't have been forced into the Treaty of Versailles
- Their economy may not have tanked and made it possible for the N@zis to rise to power.
- WWII doesn't happen because Germany doesn't start invading their neighbors.
- The Holocaust may not have happened.
- There wouldn't have been the need for the world to feel like they needed to create Israel.
