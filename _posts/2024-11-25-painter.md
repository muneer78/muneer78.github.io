When I was living with my parents after law school, I was forced to help with painting a room. It was mostly me sitting there, not being able to do anything because if I wasn't paying full attention, I'd get lectured. Eventually, we stopped painting the room actively and dad would paint a little bit after every couple of weeks or a month.

My dad was super proud of how he was able to precisely paint the edges. He's like, "Maybe I need to do this professionally!" I told him most of his clients would expect a job to be measured in days rather than decades.
