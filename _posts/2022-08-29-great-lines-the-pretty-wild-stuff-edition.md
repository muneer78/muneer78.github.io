I finally made the switch to Spotify. That means that I can now easily share interesting podcast episodes here as well. See below for more.

When I was interviewing for a new job, the HR person at my old company was still operating from the paradigm that the company held all the cards. Spoiler alert: they didn't.

I love [this story](https://www.awesemo.com/sideaction/absurd-jim-harbaugh-michigan-story-surfacing-following-urban-meyer-viral-moment-bjs/) about how Jim Harbaugh dealt with young women who were flirting with him:

> “He said to the first girl, “keep your hands up, thumbs down,” and he showed her the proper motion with his own hands. When she didn’t get quite right, he grabbed her wrists and showed her how to position her hands. He then paced off 15 yards, held the ball in front of him, squatted like he was under center, patted the ball hard, took three hard steps back, planted his back leg and fired the ball at the first girl. As he let the ball go, you could hear it click as his fingernails hit the ball and, I shit you not, as the ball whizzed through the air you could hear it ssssssssssss… THUNK! It hit the girl in the shoulder and knocked her down.

> “Come on, let’s go!” Jim barked. While Girl #1 picked herself up, Girl#2 gamely grabbed the ball and lobbed it back. Again, Jim got in his QB squat, smacked the ball, did a hard three-step drop-back and fired the ball at Girl#3, she ducked but the ball hit off the top of her head and went into the street. Girl#2 ran after it while Girl#3 sat on the ground rubbing her head. When Girl#2’s throw back to Jim was short, Jim got a bit annoyed, and set the girls up in a relay so that two girls were about 25 yards away, and the third girl was halfway in between so that that girls could throw to her, and she would run the ball to Jim. For the next 5-10 minutes, he was firing balls at these two poor girls, knocking them down or hitting them in the face about half the time. He was 100% oblivious.”

Henry Kissinger is a terrible person. Most people may not know quite how bad he was. Listen to this in order to learn the true depths of his depravity:
