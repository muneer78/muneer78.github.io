I think it was mainly feeling bad about the reactions people had to me because I would misbehave and act out. So it started with trying to figure out how to avoid that. Then, as time went on and I encountered new things, I'd sit in my room and have to think them through. I'm almost jealous of people who had their parents or religion just tell them how to be. It was a shortcut I didn't have.

But, I tried to become more religious in my 20s because I felt like it was exhausting having to figure all this stuff out. Why not just take one of the ready made templates provided by religion? I found that I questioned things too much to ever buy into it fully. That seems to be the key. At your core, you have to have unquestioning belief in the religion's core. I can't do that.
an't do that.
