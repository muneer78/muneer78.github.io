title: College Rules

In college, I had what I called the 10 to 10 rule. If people called me between those hours, the reason had to be one of 3 very specific things.

My pal Steve found a more work appropriate way to list the reasons: ladies, lira, lambada.

People tried to violate, but by sophomore year, people knew better.

Then in law school, cellphones were still new. I had a house phone, but my line was always busy because I was downloading music. Someone asked me why I couldn't get a cellphone so I was easier to reach. I just said, "I'm not going to spend $60 a month so you can call me whenever you feel like it."
