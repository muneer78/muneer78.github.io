One of the most impressive feats the GOP pulled off was convincing the poor that they should care about rich people issues.

I remember once I was sitting with my father in law, who's a Boomer. He said he didn't think it was fair that the Democrats were trying to lower the threshold for the estate tax. That tax doesn't apply unless you have over $100 million. I asked him when he thought that tax would ever be an issue for us. No answer.
