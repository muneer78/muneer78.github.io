title: Tim Walz Is The Man Loser MAGA Guys Can Never Be
tags: current-events, great-lines

When your entire identity is [trying to be hypermasculine](https://evanhurst.substack.com/p/tim-walz-is-the-man-whiny-maga-guys?publication_id=1148094&r=mtg9r) while blindly following a preening, vain narcissist, there's bound to be some cognitive dissonance: 

> Tim Walz is the negation of the desperately insecure, performatively masculine MAGA man.

> I also talked about how conservative Christians and their ideological compatriots are hellbent on preventing their children from being exposed to joyous, brilliant, successful people like Harris, because that’s a one-way ticket to their kids finding out Mommy and Daddy have been lying to them, telling them that the only way to a happy life is through the narrow path of hateful white Christian fascism.

> ...MAGA’s insecure sense of its own manhood already feels devastatingly emasculated by Tim Walz, who exudes confidence and dude-hood, the kind that doesn’t feel the need to prove it to you.
