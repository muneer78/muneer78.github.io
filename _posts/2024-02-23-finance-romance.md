The song "Bills, Bills, Bills" was the apex of a trend in 90s R&B when female singers were demanding that dudes pay all their bills. On the other hand, there were rappers bragging about stealing rent money on their way out of a lady's house. Perhaps it was a matter of need rather than greed for the R&B singers

Me and a pal were talking about why I have beef with the city of Houston. I went there in 2009 to meet a woman for a possible arranged marriage. She decided I wasn't the one for her when I made it clear that she couldn't be a housewife forever and would need to work outside the home.

I told her, "I wasn't a scrub, but I also wasn't qualified to be the person to meet Destiny's Child's demands in "Bills, Bills, Bills".
