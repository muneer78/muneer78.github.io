[MY HUSBAND DOESN’T NEED TO SEE YOUR BOOBS](https://web.archive.org/web/20140615115753/http://applesandbandaidsblog.com/2014/06/11/my-husband-doesnt-need-to-see-your-boobs):

> I am writing to share the perspective of a woman who is fighting for her marriage. And for that reason, I want to tell you that I don’t need my husband to see your boobs…I don’t blame you for being confident enough to let the world see how good you look in front of the waves with your coozie and ballcap and barely anything else. But I want to tell you that it’s a stumbling block in our marriage.

> But would you, could you, keep your boobs out of my marriage? You can have your memories, and we can have our sacred hearts. And we can all get along in beautiful harmony.
