We all know that the Supreme Court [is now a MAGA apparatus](https://ballsandstrikes.org/law-politics/voter-suppression-lawsuits-trump-next-coup-republican-party/). Trump is planning to use the courts to challenge any loss, no matter how large the margin.

> Between 1982 and 2017, the RNC was subject to a consent decree limiting its ability to take “poll-watching” measures like, for example, sending armed off-duty cops to polling places in Black neighborhoods.

> Already, the Republican Party and allies have filed over 100 lawsuits intended to make it harder to vote and harder for those votes to be counted—an unprecedented level of litigation this early in the election cycle.

> “Where we can’t get what we need,” said RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, “we’re going to be filing those lawsuits.”

> Even after the Trump immunity decision came down, the only call to action Biden could muster was asking “the American people” to “do what the Court should have been willing to do” by voting down Trump at the ballot box. This is roughly analogous to the fire chief gazing at a building engulfed in flames, glancing at a ladder truck parked next to the fire hydrant, and then turning to the anxious townspeople and urging them to start filling buckets.
