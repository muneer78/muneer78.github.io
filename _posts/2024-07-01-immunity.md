The [decision by the Supreme Court](https://ballsandstrikes.org/scotus/trump-immunity-case-maga-supreme-court-arrives/) shows they are an official arm of the MAGA machine: 

> To the extent that John Roberts ever imagined himself as a meaningful check on Trump’s power, that version of John Roberts is gone. He is as staunch a proponent of the MAGA agenda as any of his colleagues who fly coup-sympathetic flags above their homes; he just manages to be a little less uncouth about it.

> When differentiating between “official” and “unofficial” acts, Roberts continues, courts may not inquire into a president’s “motives,” which, he says, risks weaponizing the legal system for an “improper purpose.”
