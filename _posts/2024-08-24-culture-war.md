Color me shocked. People don't want to go backwards socially. We need to shame and humiliate all the culturally regressive extremists who have taken over the GOP.

Don't even get me started on Moms For Liberty. They want to enforce purity culture and anti-LGBTQ views while one of their founders is having FFM threesomes.

[Are Republicans losing the culture wars?](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/24/republicans-culture-war-races-00176166):

> School board candidates backed by Moms for Liberty, a conservative vanguard whose members popularized restrictions on classroom library books, are losing elections in Florida and some swing states. Republican leaders who rallied against critical race theory and LGBTQ+ issues recently faced recalls in red pockets of California.

> Conservative-leaning school board candidates backed by Moms for Liberty and a key supporter, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, fell this week in several races across the state. Moms for Libertyâ€™s endorsees also struggled in 2023 school board elections, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, particularly in suburban areas.

> Republican-backed candidates made inroads in conservative pockets of California in 2022, but their progress has since eroded. In just the last year, six conservatives have been recalled, eliminating four GOP-endorsed school board majorities.
