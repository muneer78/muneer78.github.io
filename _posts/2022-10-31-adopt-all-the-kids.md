I was talking to Usama bin Kevin one time and asked him, "If you're so anti-abortion, then why don't you have 30 kids living at your house?" He replied, "What do you mean???"

"You want these kids to be born, but the parents don't want them. So why aren't you taking them in?"

"You have no idea what we've tried to do!"

"It doesn't matter what you've tried thus far. You've obviously failed. If you want kids to be born, then you need to also take care of them."

He tried to change the subject after, as he usually did.
