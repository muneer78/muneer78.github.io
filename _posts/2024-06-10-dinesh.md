I have given pals money in the past, and it didn't turn out well. 

Back in the summer after sophomore year at KU, my friend Dinesh said he needed to borrow money for a few days to pay his rent, and I'd have it right back. I stupidly gave him the money and then he proceeded to not repay me in time. I had to sell some of my music CD's to get the money together to get my rent paid. 

Timeline was that I gave him the money in June, then needed to scramble in July and August to pay rent.

Anyways, I hounded him every day that summer to get my dough. He finally coughed it up like mid*August and probably borrowed it from someone else to get me to go away.

We stayed friends after that, but he knew that I was not going to ever give him another cent.

I did get him back for it later because he'd also borrowed some dough from my Thomas about 4 years later. Thomas needed money, and I knew Dinesh had just gotten a job. 
* Thomas was having a tough time. I told Thomas he needed to get his money back. We took Dinesh for a drive and Thomas told him he needed that dough. Dinesh grumbled, but we stopped by an ATM to get the paper
