Shortly after I got to the US, a bunch of kids at school said it was Halloween night and that they were so excited to get some candy. My ears perked up and I asked them for more info. They explained that they went to door to door and got free candy.

Me: So you're begging for candy?
American kid: NO! IT'S HALLOWEEN!
Me: You go to each house, ask them for candy, and don't have to pay for it?
Kid: Yeah
Me: That's called begging where I'm from.
