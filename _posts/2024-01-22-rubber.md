title: "Asking For A Rubber"
date: 2024-01-22

I needed to erase an error I had made on a worksheet. In Commonwealth countries, what we call an eraser here is called a rubber. I went up to a girl and asked her if I could borrow her rubber. She got this panicked look on her face and said she didn't have one of those. I was like, "What are you talking about?? It's right there." She ran to the teacher and the teacher stomped over and asked me what I thought I was getting at. It was then that we all realized what I was actually asking for.

This is not an isolated incident. I talked to a dude from Jamaica once who had the same thing happen to him.
