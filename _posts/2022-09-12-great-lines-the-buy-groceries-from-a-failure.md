[First](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-bachelorette-recap-season-19-episode-7-hometowns-week.html), I love Gabby's vibe on the Bachelorette this season:

> Sheâ€™s deeply invested in the power of therapy and making men feel bad about themselves in a fun way.

Second, I saw this quote on Reddit:

> It must be hard taking your car to 100 mechanics before you get to one that tells you your brakes are working just fine. It must be hard going to 100 doctors before you find the one that tells you your cholesterol level is healthy.


A quote by Krusty the Clown from the Simpsons episode, "[Bart the Fink](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bart_the_Fink/Quotes)":

> There's no silver lining here. I was a big cheese! A huge cheese! But now, look at me. I gotta ride the bus like a schnook! I gotta live in an apartment like an idiot! I gotta wait in line with nobodies to buy groceries from a failure!

The DC Sniper case was a national event while I was still in law school. I was in the middle of wasting $56,000 on a degree I don't use, so I didn't follow it as closely as I would have wanted. Here's a series of podcasts from You're Wrong About that go into the true motives of John Muhammad and Lee Malvo:
