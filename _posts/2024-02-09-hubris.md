I got a little overwhelmed with having to do too many things at once, and made a betting mistake. I explained it as follows to a pal:

Now I'm out like $5 from these various errors. And I only have a bet on VCU for their game tonight. I don't know why I operated with such hubris, thinking I could do it all. I am not a woman of the 80's.
