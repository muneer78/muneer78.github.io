**Muneer**:  Steve and I have decided to embark upon a new business venture that we just realized has been approved by God. We are going to tailgate Covid vaccine lines and sell tasty ribs, sausages and hot links to the unwashed masses. The name of our business will be a combo of our names: Steer. God gave us both the perfect names to combine into a name for a predatory BBQ business.
**Wife**: Who’s doing the cooking?
**Muneer**: We're looking into the exciting world of undocumented labor to procure our pitmaster.
**Steve**: It's nice to finally have a purpose in life. I've coasted aimlessly for so long.
**Muneer**: Me too, brother. Me too.
