[Panthers CB Josh Norman: 'Went Dark Knight' after Dez Bryant disrespect](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/14233577/josh-norman-carolina-panthers-says-dez-bryant-dallas-cowboys-disrespected-him)

> [Josh] Norman said he was so fired up during the week with talk about [Dez] Bryant possibly having a big day against him and the unbeaten Panthers (now 11-0) being an underdog that he had to go watch the movie "300" to get him to a dark place.

> He had planned to save that movie for motivation later in the season.
