On this day in 1845, my ancestor Muhammad O'Halloran reached Ireland after fleeing a famine in India. He only had a chance to have a couple of potatoes before the Potato Famine hit. As a result, he never grew accustomed to eating potatoes and was disgusted by the sight of them.

Muhammad Cobretti was on the same ship as my other uncle, Muhammad O'Halloran. They had a great enmity and so when Muhammad O'Halloran expressed his intent to get off in Ireland, Muhammad Cobretti jumped ship in Italy.

He became the eminent sausage maker in the country, which was the cruelest outcome of all. He remained Muslim, and thus could never eat his creations.
