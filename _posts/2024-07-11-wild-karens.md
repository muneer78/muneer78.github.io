title: Karens in the Wild

Packs of wild karens' can often be found at Applebee's brunch, one of their last remaining natural habitats.

There is an underlying aggression amongst the pack as each karen tries to assert dominance over the others. This is done by enlarging their hairdos, bragging about their children's accomplishments, and subtly insulting potential challengers.

I'm just a researcher telling you where they gather.
