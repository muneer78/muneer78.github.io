Dude, when I worked for JPMorgan, I remember reading something that chilled me to my core.

The intranet had an article that was something like "A Day in the Life of An Analyst".
- This lady came in to work at 7am
- Didn't get to have a lunch until 4.45pm because of how busy she was.
- Gets told that there's a client presentation tomorrow, so works on it from 6-11.30pm
- Gets back on the train to head home at midnight

It was meant to inspire us, I guess. But I vowed never to do anything like that. I did end up doing some crazy hours a few years, and I regret it deeply.
