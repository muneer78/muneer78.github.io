[Wisdom from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/u1ycv2/annoying_neighbor_complains_about_my_balls/i4fjixe/?context=3):

> If you put something up in a common area with the express purpose of pissing people off, you're an asshole.
> 
> That's it. If you want every single person who passes your house to sigh and wish you would go away, you're an asshole.
> 
> I don't give a shit if it's a Fuck Biden flag, a Fuck Trump Flag, Door Nuts, a sticker of a sexy Angel eating out a sexy Devil on your car, most bumper stickers, truck nuts etc.
> 
> It's a person making their personality "I hope someone sees this and gets mad." That is a shitty personality component, I don't care who does it.
> 
> It's not the end of the world, they don't deserve to be evicted or stoned in the streets, but I guarantee they suck.
> 
> And posting the letter is really all the proof you need. They _wanted_ a letter like this. The idea that they've driven a real person into some crazy religious rage makes them giggle.
> 
> Again, some balls on a door aren't going to kill anyone. But the balls aren't there for some noble expression of art. They're there to make other people's lives just a little worse. And life is shitty enough.
