In S1 of Jersey Shore, Angelina threatens the Situation by saying, "Yo, I will cut your hair while you're sleeping." 

I began saying this to everyone as my standard threat/promise to them. I once said it to my friend's daughter, who is black. That was seen as "insensitive" and "crossing the line".
