title: "Rejecting The Far Right's Bad Faith Arguments"
---

I'm tired of the Democrats' weird dedication to civility and bi-partisanship when it hasn't been reciprocated at any point in the last 50 years. All the Dems have done is become a center-right party instead of sticking with the Progressive principles that allowed the New Deal and civil rights legislation to pass. The GOP has no issues using scorched Earth tactics to get their way. Time for the Dems to fight fire with fire.

> Walz and his Democratic colleagues in the Minnesota legislature are good reminders that better things are possible, but only if the left completely ignores right-wing whining and bad-faith attacks meant to sound like real policy critiques.

The description of the Dems in this article reminds me of this tweet from 2018:
