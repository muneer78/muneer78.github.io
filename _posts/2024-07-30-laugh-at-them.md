I've been trying to figure out how to effectively deal with Trump supporters. I think the best way to go is to point out how dumb their ideas are. Ridicule their words mercilessly. Point out how absurd what they believe is. 

Fascists and their sympathizers (which anyone voting for Trump is) think of themselves as the most serious people in the world. By laughing at them, you cause them to experience an internal dissonance they can't deal with. They haven't thought through their ideas or are acting in total bad faith. Exposing either isn't something most people can take. Anyone who supports MAGA deserves nothing but scorn. They deserve it.
