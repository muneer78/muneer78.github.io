[Salesforce Is Using A Hallucination To Sell AI](https://defector.com/salesforce-is-using-a-hallucination-to-sell-ai):

> ... why—for the love of God, why—would McConaughey let himself be seated outside during this downpour? Why has he decided to be complicit in his own abjection?

> Why is he just sitting there? He is deliberately immiserating himself through inaction, while the only people who could conceivably help him are instead making his situation worse. 

> Who is more likely to sit in obvious discomfort for reasons they cannot articulate, international superstar Matthew McConaughey or self-destructive nihilist Rust Cohle? ("I tell myself I bear witness, but the real answer is that it's obviously my programming, and I lack the constitution for suicide.")

> Harrelson considers McConaughey in a way that AI could never: as a person, with autonomy and agency. Harrelson reaches out to him with love, beckoning him back to humanity. In doing so, Harrelson gives McConaughey that which had been taken from him, that what he could not see he needed: a choice. He is free to leave this cursed place, and at long last, become fully himself again. 

> Given what we've seen here, it is clear what AI is meant to be. AI is meant to be ignored, discarded, rejected in favor of the shelter of community and the warm embrace of a friend. Rust Cohle, again:
>> To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room, a dream about being a person.
