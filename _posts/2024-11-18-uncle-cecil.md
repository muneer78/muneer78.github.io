I know of a shadowy figure known only as 'Uncle Cecil' through my former barber. Uncle Cecil was selling specially programmed Amazon Fire sticks that could get you access to all the legacy cable channels.

I was banned from any dealings with Uncle Cecil by my wife when I first learned of him. But perhaps it's worth revisiting in this increasingly fractured media landscape.
