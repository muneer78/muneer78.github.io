Kareem Abdul Jabbar [said the following](https://kareem.substack.com/p/the-debate-trump-weirdly-lies-about) about Trump voters:

> This election has made me more afraid for the future of the United States than any previous election. Not simply because Trump is running, but because the fact that he’s running—and doing as well as he is—after a disastrous four years in office, reveals a larger part of our population than I had realized is more irrational, self-destructive, uninformed, and harmful to their children’s futures.
