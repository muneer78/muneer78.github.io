First, this is one of the more extreme reactions to messing up a poker game:

> Sam Peckinpah's later movies - He had a crew and some actors he hired for different movies, so they'd gotten to know each other. On the set of The Ballad of Cable Hogue, they had a regular poker game going. Even on a good day, Peckinpah was a cantankerous alcoholic. On one of his worse days, he was standing by the poker table. In a fit of pique, he mixed up everything on the table, so the hands were screwed up, the pot was a mess, and everyone's money was hopelessly confused. With that the crew had finally had it. They started a collection to hire a hit man to have him killed. One of the actors intervened to calm everyone down.

Third, there are a few great turns of phrase in this tweet:
