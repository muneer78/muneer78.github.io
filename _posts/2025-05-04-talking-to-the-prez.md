[Talking To The President](https://defector.com/talking-to-the-president):

> You will, for some reason, always be able to see Trump's entire body in a chair, squatting and heaving and canted in an uncanny way that might remind you of Blanka from Street Fighter wearing a suit.

> The whole cabinet that Trump has cast is people who live like thisâ€”reckless, stupid, proud, strange, unaccountable people who are not so much incapable of learning as they are fundamentally uninterested in any perspective and allergic to any truth but their own.

> More to the point, though, there is no point in pressing Trump any further, because he is lying in a way that is so unsophisticated and profound as to be impenetrable.
