A man called in with an unusual request. He needed me to contact Interpol on his behalf. This man had gotten into touch with some men in the African nation of Benin (I wasn't told how the two parties met). The man calling me had completed a couple of transactions with these men to buy diamonds, spending around $2,000 each time. After the completion of the second sale, the Beninois told the man they had an unbelievable deal for him. They would send him a diamond worth at least $1,000,000 for only $50,000. The man promptly wired the money to Benin. After the money was received, the Beninois mysteriously disappeared.



**Me**: Did you know these people personally?  

**Man**: No. I only conversed with them over the Internet.  

**Me**: Just curious, but how were they going to get the diamond to you?  

**Man**: We agreed that the diamond would be sent by DHL.  

**Me**: Wait a second. Did you intend to declare the diamond and pay import duties?  

**Man**: Why would I need to do that? They were sending it via DHL.  

**Me**: DHL packages can be checked by customs.  

**Man**: They can?  

**Me**: Yes. Anyway, I can't initiate an inquiry to Interpol. You'll have to go through the [state] Bureau of Investigation.  

**Man**: Will they find the **Me**n?  

**Me**: Not very likely. You have been tricked by criminals.  

**Man**: I see. I suppose I should tell my wife.  

**Me**: Not a bad idea.n**: Will they find the **Me**n?  

**Me**: Not very likely. You have been tricked by criminals.  

**Man**: I see. I suppose I should tell my wife.  

**Me**: Not a bad idea.
