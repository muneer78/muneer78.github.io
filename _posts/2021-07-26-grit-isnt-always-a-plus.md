From Eric Barker's book, [Barking Up the Wrong Tree](https://bookshop.org/books/barking-up-the-wrong-tree-the-surprising-science-behind-why-everything-you-know-about-success-is-mostly-wrong/9780062416049):

I know plenty of people for whom grit is a liability because it allows them to stick with something that makes them or others miserable and towards no long-term good aim.


Kenny Rogers also put it well:
> You got to know when to hold 'em,
> Know when to fold 'em,
> Know when to walk away,
> And know when to run.
