From [Tumblr](https://ventusregina.tumblr.com/post/187632691138/one-of-the-biggest-power-moves-i-have-here-in-the):

> One of the biggest power moves I have here in the midwest when someone is being racist, sexist, homophobic is that I tell them that I’ll pray for them so that god can grace them with empathy, or that “I feel sorry the devil has made his home in your heart” cause you have not felt joy until you’ve flipped the script on a suburban house mom or an old racist white man.  The joy of watching their face in shock and confusion while they’re called out in Christian Standards the same way they try to cover for their homophobia is amazing.  100% suggest it, at the very least it gets them to shut the fuck up.

> And if they start to stutter and quote some cherry-picked Bible verse at you, come back at them with, "Yes, even the Devil can quote scripture, but that doesn't mean he understands it. I'll pray for God to grant you understanding in the fullness of His word.
