Ever since I saw this, I can never stop laughing when I see it:

This Reddit post about Adolf Eichmann has some very deep insights about why people choose to believe in things like conspiracy theories:

> In a search for some higher meaning, he gave himself to a cause so completely that he was unable to think outside of its cliches, standard lines... or from the point of view of other people. By adopting a cause Eichmann created a intellectual fence around himself and relieved himself of having to think critically or examine his convictions.

> There is pleasure in understanding the world around us and meaning in the unending work of developing and refining a coherent world view. Adopting an ideology, short circuits that effort, providing pleasure and meaning with an unwarranted (and unquestioned) degree of certainty. Consequently, fully adopting an ideology, whether it&#39;s Nazism or Feminism, is fundamentally not a benign act. People do this on a regular basis: unquestioned, mild, allegiance to their church, to their political party, to traditional values, to their social causes, etc. This is the essence of &quot;the banality of evil&quot; that Arendt talks about. There is a strong intellectual resemblance between the unquestioned beliefs and unexamined assumptions that allow a man to ship millions of people to extermination camps, and the unquestioned assumptions and beliefs that we all operate on, on a daily basis. Psychopathic cruelty and blood-thirst are not required.
