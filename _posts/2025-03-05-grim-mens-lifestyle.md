After hearing about the grim men's lifestyle, I have a way to describe how I felt when I went to the club in college.

[Paul Pierce Loses ESPN Gig After Broadcasting Grim Men's Evening](https://defector.com/paul-pierce-loses-espn-gig-after-broadcasting-grim-mens-evening):

> Why did Paul Pierce do this? It's certainly fair to assume that his mind was under the effects of various substances when he decided to fire up the livestream. Or maybe he was totally clear-headed, and just wanted to show all of his friends and fans how much fun it is to be 43 years old, array a dozen or so office chairs in your cavernous foyer, and sullenly play a few hands of poker while a handful of women mill around and dance.

[Paul Pierce Does Not Regret Grim Men's Evening, Embraces Grim Men's Lifestyle | Defector](https://defector.com/paul-pierce-does-not-regret-grim-mens-evening-embraces-grim-mens-lifestyle):

> Maybe you would have regrets about getting stupendously drunk one night and then hopping on Instagram Live so that thousands of people could watch you paw at your own glassy eyes while forcing various ladies and dudes into desultory interactions with you, but that is only because you are not as committed to living life in the grimmest possible terms. You, my friend, are not grimpilled.

> There is a method of self-actualization that is only available to a certain class of American men, and it's a process that can only be completed by those willing to speak the holy words aloud. I'm divorced. I'm retired. I'm having fun. Pierce completed this ritual, and now his grim men's evening has become infinite
> 
> Let this be a lesson to all those who don't want to end up spending their lives sexually harassing waitresses while cackling to nobody in particular: Once the grim men's lifestyle begins, there is no escaping it.

[Paul Pierce Had A Grim Men's Cake For His Birthday | Defector](https://defector.com/paul-pierce-had-a-grim-mens-cake-for-his-birthday):

> It's been 17 months since ESPN fired Paul Pierce for jumping on Instagram Live to show the world the devastating nature of his home life.

> This is the most unpleasant image to ever appear on a birthday cake. The flavor isn't chocolate or red velvet, but Atlantic City casino floor. The frosting is infused with stale hookah smoke. David Lynch has spent his entire career trying to compose a single frame as heart-stopping as a sodden and swollen Paul Pierce posing in front of a stripper laying a few feet away from an office chair on a living-room floor, and he has not succeeded. It would be less depressing to look at photos of a crime scene. 

> Hopefully everyone who attended the bash had a nice time and avoided the cake. It's never a good idea to eat something trapping a tortured soul.

[Paul Pierce Traps Kevin Garnett In Grim Men's Livestream | Defector](https://defector.com/paul-pierce-traps-kevin-garnett-in-grim-mens-livestream):

> This is not a man who just occasionally stumbles into a brutal night of masculine reverie by chance, but one who is deeply committed to the lifestyle. Pierce does not find his way into a grim men's evening; he inflicts one upon whatever place he happens to be.

> The Ballmerite vision of this involves the glitziest and most glamorous Angelenos doing business deals deep into the wee hours—in the VIP suites, to reiterate, at Los Angeles Clippers games—but in actuality, it more likely will mean exhausted bartenders being forced to keep serving besotted, grim-smelling dudes with harrowingly complex Bones Hyland opinions, deep into the bleak morning.

[Doug Gottlieb Is Immersed In The Grim Men's Lifestyle | Defector](https://defector.com/doug-gottlieb-is-immersed-in-the-grim-mens-lifestyle)

>> As for the perception that a coach fails unless he’s grinding on tape from dark to dark, Gottlieb counters with this: He’s divorced. He lives alone in a former Vrbo he bought fully furnished so he could move in the same day. His biggest chore is keeping a seven-month-old Sheepadoodle from eating chicken out of the garbage.

>> The only personal items downstairs are a headset and a soundboard sitting on the bar, where he hosts his radio show, and a few half-empty liquor bottles scattered on the back bar.

>> Moreover, Gottlieb is divorced and his kids are in Oklahoma, so right now "there aren't demands on being home for family," he says. He says he uses what would be family time to pour back into his program when they aren't around, and he says it in a way that spills out with a sense of dejection, revealing the emotional tax he's paying of being nearly 1,000 miles away from his twin daughters, Harper and Grace, and his son, Hayes.

> "That's the hardest part," Gottlieb said. "It sucks."

>> "Let all negativity be gone forever," he says in a droning, sober tone. It's a dramatic shift from his bombastic delivery and over-the-top energy he brings to his daily radio show. "Bring love and happiness and protection to this house, and myself." 
>>
>> He repeats it again and again, walking from one side of the court to the other in a circle.
