From a meme on Tumblr:

> Tell me a soft memory

> My oldest brother is 10 years older than me.
>
> When I was in first grade, he took me shopping for new school clothes which was huge because, as the youngest of six kids, I lived in hand-me-downs.

> He bought me a little navy blue, polka dot dress with a Peter Pan collar and red alphabet buttons. But, on picture day, I lost one of the buttons on the playground. I had a total meltdown because my brother spent his own money to make sure I had this new dress and I ruined it. I was a mess, totally inconsolable.

> My teacher was also the mom of one of my brother's best friends. She told him, and he, my brother and the entire football team searched the playground after practice for my lost button. Which they actually found.

> My brother sewed the button back on himself in the car all while trying to explain that he wouldn't have been mad even if I did lose it.

> It was just a button and a dress.

> But I did have one of those little red alphabet buttons sewn into my wedding dress.
