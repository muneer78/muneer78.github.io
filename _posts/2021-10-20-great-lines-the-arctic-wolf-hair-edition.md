For those who don't know, I've decided to find a new job. I didn't want there to be any ambiguity, so I told my boss the day after I'd made my decision. I feel both lighter and more anxious about taking the next step in my working life. But, the worker shortage is real. In the 3 weeks I've been applying, I've gotten 3 interviews and they've all gone to a second interview. I've never been this in demand in the job market.

If a yahoo like me can get this much interest, then so can you. If you are feeling like you could use a change, there may not be a better time to look for a new job. And on the plus side, you'll likely get paid more at a new job.

I love this quote about Wilt Chamberlain. Steve has been informed that it must be a part of my eulogy:

>"He portrays himself as both the main character of mid century America and a bemused loner who just wants to hang out in his mansion festooned in ethically sourced Arctic wolf hair."
