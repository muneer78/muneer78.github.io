I think both parties are too corrupt to be trusted. When I vote, I'm picking the lesser of 2 evils rather than voting for a party.

We need additional viable parties, and then you'd have to build a coalition government in order to be able to pass legislation. Just look at this border nonsense. If we had a multi-party system, then the extremists get minimized and things get done.
