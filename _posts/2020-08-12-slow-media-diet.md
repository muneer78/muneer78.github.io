I've tried to create a [slow media diet](https://www.cjr.org/news_literacy/slow_news_news_diet.php), and was successful for a short time, but my ADHD always makes me want to see more and more and then I'm back to trying to consume a firehose:

> Question 1: Why am I consuming this news?

> Question 2: What is the most effective way for me to consume news?

> Question 3: Do I want to act on this news?
