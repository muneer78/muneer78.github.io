In college, me and my roommates were looking for stuff to buy that was cheap and would be filling. We happened upon Stovetop stuffing. Once we made it, we immediately went back out and bought enough for the next 2 weeks and ate it at dinner every night. Thus began a love affair that has never abated. I'll still crush some Stovetop!
