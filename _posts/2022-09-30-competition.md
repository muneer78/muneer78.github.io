Friend's wife wanted to run for elected office, and he didn't want her to. I told him to do the following:

> Tell her you’ve converted to Islam and are searching for Wife #2. If Republicans have taught us anything, it’s that competition should be encouraged in all arenas of life.
>
> If you had a ditzy 25 year old Russian wife #2, her calculus would be quite different.
>
> Unfortunately, she would definitely educate Svetlana about her options, and then you’d have two women deeply involved in Democratic politics.

He said they'd probably just get with each other. I said:

> I hadn’t even considered the Sapphic Solution!!
