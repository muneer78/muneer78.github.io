She's So High was the beginning of my transition into the outspoken feminist I am today

I got the MP3 of that song from Napster and put it on one of the first mix CDs I ever burned. It was my sensitive mix, that I only listened to in the dead of night, with all windows closed, at low volume.

By day, I was big ballin' and ruff rydin', rocking the Atlanta Braves 3XL tee with the baggy jeans and chain. But after the sun set, I would slide into a more mellow mindset

And finally, Iâ€™d be ready to transition into the [Muneer After Dark](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0zmu0TKFcGQD2ssDolY8GU?si=InatFdtyR7S4DRhuGO40oQ&pi=u-zYJkfaHaTluo) playlist.
