Here's the complicated way I track what I want to read.

1. If I want to read something every day or want to see it soon after it's posted or sent:
    a. I send it to a service called Omnivore. 
    b. They allow the addition of RSS feeds and newsletters.
2. If I want to keep track of what a site posts, but want to be able to skim the headlines, that's where my fake news site comes in.
3. If I want to read something when I get to it during the week:
    a. I send it to a service called Newsblur. 
    b. They allow the addition of RSS feeds and newsletters.
    c. I signed up for premium service like 8 years ago and they never turned it off.
4. If I want to check it when I don't have anything to do and I've exhausted everything in #1 and #2, I have some feeds going to a service called Feedland.
