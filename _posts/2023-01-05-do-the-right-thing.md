I was trying to get people at the office to eat the rest of a cake I'd brought in:

It's close to the end of the day. Some of us have sleep problems. You know what could help with that? A slice of chocolate espresso cake with salted caramel butter cream frosting. The sugar should make your system crash at just the right time.

If you're in the office, do what's right for you. Have some cake.
