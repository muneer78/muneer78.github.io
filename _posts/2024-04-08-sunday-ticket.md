My pal had no issues getting NFL Sunday Ticket before getting married. They got married in May or June, and she was beefing about it when renewal time came around in September.

I should have given the context.
- My pal and his wife lived together before getting married. 
- During the time she was still a fiancee, he'd check with her before renewing the NFL Sunday Ticket package on DirectTV, and she was all on board.
- She'd even be out there on Sundays making snacks and watching the game like she was invested in it.
- But then they get married, and the mask dropped. She said she didn't care about football and that the Sunday Ticket money could be spent on better things.

This shook up the rest of us. We were suddenly giving all our partners extra scrutiny to see if a similar fraud was being perpetrated on us.
