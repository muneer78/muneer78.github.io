[I’m a Free-Thinking Centrist with Only Right-Wing Ideas](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-a-free-thinking-centrist-with-only-right-wing-ideas):

> I’ve been red-pilled, but I think The Matrix was just okay. I voted for Trump, but I respect Democrats like John Fetterman who are willing to reach across the aisle to promote ethnic cleansing. And I’m still a Bernie fan, even though I openly mock AOC and Elizabeth Warren for subscribing to 90 percent of the same policies, for reasons, I assure you, I will never ask myself a single hard question about, because I’m not bound by your restrictive mental framework.

> I get my news from a broad variety of sources. I follow not only Elon Musk directly but also outlets that screenshot his posts without analysis. I scour major news outlets for op-eds that don’t contain lefty catchphrases like “upending the global economic order” or “threatening our national security”—only until I’ve reached my free article limit for the month, since paying for journalism only encourages more bias. I even posted a Rachel Maddow clip one time where a guy interrupted her to explain why she was wrong.
