Kendrick Lamar's verse on "Control" has sparked a controversy in the hip hop world. After going down a rabbit hole, I found [this awesome article ](https://href.li/?http://www.complex.com/entertainment/2011/06/the-50-best-hip-hop-diss-songs/)about the stories behind 50 rap beefs. I will present the highlights without comment, because they need no embellishment.

Nicki Minaj "Roman's Revenge" (2010)
Target: Lil Kim
*“… the track left the once-legendary Kim grasping for straws and desperately lying about mixtape sales on Paypal.”*

Kurupt "Callin' Out Names" (1999)
Target: Ja Rule, Belly, The Firm, Foxy Brown, Irv Gotti, Murder Inc., DMX
*This track played out more like a drunken tirade and could be best remembered as the first time a rapper dissed a movie cast ("Fuck Belly").*

Noreaga "Halfway Thug Pt. 2" (1998)
Target: Tragedy Khadafi
*“… accused Trag of being a 37-year-old ham-eating Muslim…”*

50 Cent "Piggy Bank" (2005)
Target: Nas, Jadakiss, Mobb Deep, Ja Rule, Kelis, Shyne, Fat Joe, Lil Kim
*“but does score points for depicting Nas as "Captain Save Em" chasing down the Kelis "Milkshake" truck”*

U.N.L.V. "Drag Em In The River" (1996)
Target: Big Boy Records, Mystikal
*“… a scorching N.O. anthem that poked fun at Mystikal's braids and his past as a high school cheerleader..”*

MC Eiht "Def Wish" (1991-1996)
Target: DJ Quik (I-IV)
*“… paints Quik as a goofy, perm-wearing, clucker in a Khaki bikini.”*

Jadakiss "Checkmate" (2005)
Target: 50 Cent
*“The track was filled with quotables, with Kiss alluding to 50 being a snitch, having the weakest flow in G-Unit, and asks what's so cool about being shot nine times and not shooting back.”*

Royce Da 5'9" "Malcolm X" (2003)
Target: D12
*This hilarious yet vicious track poked fun at each and every member of the Dirty Dozen, picking apart Bizarre for being fat and stuttering and predicting members would be raking 50 Cent's leaves in the near future.*

T.I. "99 Problems (Lil Flip Ain't One)" (2004)
Target: Lil Flip
*Once free, T.I. went on a Lil Flip slander campaign, claiming it was game over for Flip, who was nothing but a studio gangster who lived in the suburbs and wore Leprechaun outfits (which Flip famously donned on the cover of his The Leprechaun album). The beef was eventually squashed, but not before the two came to fisticuffs in Flip's Houston neighborhood of Cloverland, where T.I. was visiting with a camera crew to expose Flip as a fraud.*

Cam'Ron f/ Jim Jones "Hate Me Now" (2002)
Target: Nas
*Lines were crossed, low-blows were thrown and Jim Jones introduced the amazing term, "Kufi Slapper."*

Jay-Z "Super Ugly" (2001)
Target: Carmen, Nas
*However, a closer inspection reveals a ruthless and remorseless diss, in which Jay brags about sexing Nas' baby-mother, Carmen Bryan, and leaving condoms on his daughter Destiny's car seat, that even had Hov's Mom insisted he issue a public apology to Nas and family to which Jay obliged.*

LL Cool J "To Da Break Of Dawn" (1990)
Target: Ice T, MC Hammer, Kool Moe Dee
*Dedicating one verse to each foe, LL mocked Kool Moe Dee for wearing "Star Trek shades," called MC Hammer a gym teacher, and clowned Ice-T for being a parking-lot employee with a perm.*

Nas "Ether" (2001)
Target: Jay-Z
*“…calling Jay-Z a camel…”*

Jay-Z "Takeover" (2001)
Target: Prodigy, Nas
*Prodigy of Mobb Deep was dissed on the second verse, but this was dramatically overshadowed by Jay's beef with Nas. Hov's shots at P focused on his small stature, smaller record sales, and the infamous "ballerina" pic he flashed on the screen at Summer Jam 2001.*
*The Nas portion was far more brutal, attacking Nas' descent from hip-hop's top MC list to a guy who was now being out-rapped on posse cuts by his bodyguard. Jay went on to clown Nas' catalog, and on the final line alluded to sexing Nas' baby-mother, Carmen Bryan.*
