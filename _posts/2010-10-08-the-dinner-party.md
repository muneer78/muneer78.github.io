**[Friend]:** We'll bring something nice to eat. I'm not sure what, though. Any suggestions?

**Muneer:** I believe you should bring king prawns simmered in butter and curry powder.

**[Friend]:** But [Other Friend] and [Other Friend] are vegetarians!

**Muneer:** True, so you should also bring naan for their lentil curry and my prawns.
