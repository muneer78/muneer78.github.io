Many thanks to the extremists at the Heritage Foundation for finally creating a policy platform that goes too far for the average voter, no matter how uninformed they are.

[Who Wants To Talk About The Issues](https://defector.com/who-wants-to-talk-about-the-issues):

> [Project 2025] is an unsoftened product of the deepest right-wing ghoulosphere. 

> That people care about things like this is a genuine breakthrough. A longstanding problem for Democratic campaigns has been that voters don't like to believe Republicans could possibly support the policies Republicans support.

Trump [doesn't want to have an election](https://www.mediaite.com/trump/trump-says-why-are-we-having-an-election-after-harris-got-nomination-without-primary-votes-they-didnt-have-an-election/) because he's leading, Kamala led a coup, and other fascist reasons:

> You know, they do polls on this stuff, and I’m at like 93%. I said, so why are we having an election? They didn’t have an election. Why are we having an election?

The crowd size talk is him trying to [lay the groundwork for another coup](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-sinister-clown-next-insurrection/). His cult will be more than willing to oblige. Bernie Sanders said it best: 

> Donald Trump may be crazy, but he’s not stupid. When he claims that “nobody” showed up at a 10,000 person Harris-Walz rally in Michigan that was live-streamed and widely covered by the media, that it was all AI, and that Democrats cheat all the time, there is a method to his madness. Clearly, and dangerously, what Trump is doing is laying the groundwork for rejecting the election results if he loses. If you can convince your supporters that thousands of people who attended a televised rally do not exist, it will not be hard to convince them that the election returns in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and elsewhere are “fake” and “fraudulent.”
