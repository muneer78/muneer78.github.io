Urban Meyer has been trash [since the beginning](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/mike-bianchi-commentary/os-sp-urban-meyer-jaguars-fired-mike-bianchi-column-20211216-aqsztfyeynfr5nmwf64q5jgomq-story.html) of his career: 

> It’s ironic that Meyer was fired from perhaps his last coaching job for bullying a player (Lambo ) when, in fact, one of his first coaching jobs nearly ended with him bullying a player.
>
> Meyer was a young wide receivers coach under Sonny Lubick at Colorado State in 1990 when he was called on the carpet by Lubick for bullying and berating one of the team’s receivers to a point where the receiver quit the team because he could not stomach Meyer’s personal attacks.
>
> Lubick had seen enough. He called Meyer into his office and read him the riot act; told him he was a football coach, not a drill sergeant.
>
> “I just called him in and told him that sort of stuff doesn’t fly anymore,” Lubick told me once. “Urban was too good a coach to have to coach that way. If he kept doing it, it was going to come back and kill his career.”
