['Very unpopular': Editor of conservative outlet admits 'weak' Trump is 'definitely nuts'](https://www.alternet.org/conservative-outlet-trump/):

> Wright noted that throughout Trump's time in the White House, he "won by a razor's edge" in 2016, never enjoyed more than 49% support in public approval ratings and 'yet has carried on as though he was given a huge national mandate and enjoys major popular support when there’s zero evidence for that proposition.'

> 'He’s losing because he’s a weak, unpopular, undisciplined candidate running at the head of a weak, minority electoral coalition. That’s the truth, whether anyone wants to hear it or not.'
