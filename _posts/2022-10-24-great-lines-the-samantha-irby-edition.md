I love me some Samantha Irby. I haven't read her books, but if you haven't subscribed to her [Judge Mathis recap newsletter](https://bitchesgottaeat.substack.com/), get on that immediately.

[First](https://bitchesgottaeat.substack.com/p/whos-on-judge-mathis-today-224?s=r), this is how I describe my life:
> i had to take a break because the universe won’t stop testing me, god’s weariest lieutenant...

[Second](https://bitchesgottaeat.substack.com/p/whos-on-judge-mathis-today-229), this should become my new strategy when it comes to interpersonal relationships:

> after a while it was just too much drama for her to keep seeing him (her words: god don’t bless no mess!) and she is a businesswoman with a business to run so she told him to get his ass on.

[Third](https://bitchesgottaeat.substack.com/p/who-was-on-judge-mathis-yesterday-767), don't let someone who you're in a deep relationship convince you otherwise:

> i’m sorry but if you need to receive faxes at my crib??? we’re doing a little more than just “kicking it.” i could see the judge’s face change as david started down this fuckboy road (FEMINIST KING) and he’s like “there’s no way you brought a keyboard and a fax machine over to this lady’s house if you weren’t living with her!” i know david thinks that it was just his phone and sweatsocks that lived with toni but sorry pal this don’t work like that! outdated technologies make you a resident!!!
