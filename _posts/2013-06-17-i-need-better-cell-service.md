<p>A woman called in about the deterioration in her cellphone service. She was a legacy customer of Cellular One, which had recently been acquired by U.S. Cellular. I asked her when her contract was up, and she told me it would expire in 2 months' time. So, I offered to contact U.S. Cellular to see if they would let her cancel her contract with no penalty.</p>

**Woman**: I don't want to cancel! I want better service.<br />
**Me**: I understand. If we get your contract cancelled, then you can move to another company that has better cell reception.<br />
**Woman**: I just want better cell service! I don't want to change my company! I been with them for a long time.<br />
**Me**: How do you think that your cell reception will get better if you stay with U.S. Cellular?<br />
**Woman**: I don't know! I need you to make them do something!<br />
**Me**: They're not going to move a cell tower closer to your house so your signal gets better.<br />
**Woman**: Why not????<br />
