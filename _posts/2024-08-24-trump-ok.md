[Is Trump OK? Unhinged reaction to rise of Harris worries supporters](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/donald-trump-mental-fitness-campaign): 

> Since Harris assumed the mantle of the presumptive Democratic candidate, Trump has claimed to be better-looking than the vice-president, questioned whether she is really Black and attacked her laugh as that of 'a lunatic'.

> Melania’s reaction to her husband’s implicit claim that he is better-looking than his wife is not known.

> [Trump] told reporters that he was “very angry” at Harris for calling him weird and was “entitled to personal attacks”.

> When the focus was on Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said every presidential candidate should be required to take a cognitive test. Pressed this week by CBS News on whether he has done so himself, Trump claimed to have recently had a “perfect score” on two cognitive tests.
>
> “I got everything right. And one of the doctors said, ‘I’ve never seen that before, where you get everything right,’” he said.
