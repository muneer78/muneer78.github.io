**Muneer**: I just want the Supreme Court nomination ceremony to end up being like the opening scene in King Ralph.

**Steve**: That takes me back.

**Muneer**: Instead of it all happening at once, it can happen over a few weeks or months.

**Muneer**: But at the end of the day, a Canadian named Gordie Ashton will be named president.  He will bring moose and Tim Hortons along with social programs.

**Lisette**: Haaa.

**Steve**: I, for one, welcome our Canadian overlords.

**Muneer**: Brought up my King Ralph scenario to some pals at work. They pointed out that Gordie Ashton is ineligible to be the president since he's Canadian.

I feel like Gordie being the illegitimate son of a rogue American diplomat confers automatic American citizenship upon him.

**Lisette**: Yeah thereâ€™s a little thing called dual citizenship. Tired of these birthers.

**Muneer**: Exactly!!
