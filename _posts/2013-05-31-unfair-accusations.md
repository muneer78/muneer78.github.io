A woman called in about the police unfairly targeting her son. The son's phone was found near the scene of an arson; he was currently sitting in jail.

**Woman**: They're always accusing him of stuff!
**Me**: Like what?
**Woman**: Oh you know: robbery, attempted murder, burglary, drug possession with intent to distribute.

This wasn't the main issue though.

**Woman**: Is it legal for the police to look at my son's text messages?
**Me**: If they have probable cause to believe that the phone was used in furtherance of a crime, then yes.
**Woman**: That should be illegal! They're trying to get him on drug charges because someone sent him a text asking if he could get them some weed.
**Me**: They're allowed to do that.
**Woman**: That's so unfair!
