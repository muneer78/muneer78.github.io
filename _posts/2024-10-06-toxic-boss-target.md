[(From Threads](https://www.threads.net/@jennnaababe/post/C-L3MYjMZiL):

> Toxic bosses rarely change. They just change targets. You are never safe, even if you think it could never happen to you because you’ve been “accepted” in the in group. You are never safe because these individuals eventually turn and need a new scapegoat. It’s all by design.
