First, allowing people to "just walk in" isn't something that concerns me. There are not enought people who are doing it. We have 360 million people in this country. There aren't nearly enough people crossing the border to cause an actual negative impact to me. 

I used to be against people crossing without papers, but then I thought about it from the standpoint of we need to make things better for the next generation. 

The people who are already here are a sunk cost . If they’ve built a life and have families and aren’t criminals, there should be a pathway for them to stay. Focus ICE on stopping new people from entering instead of raiding people who are already here 

A lot of this country's economy depends on undocumented labor. It's something that the xenophobes don't want to acknowledge. Want to pay $200 for a lawn chair? How about $40 per pound of strawberries? Didn't think so.

I think we should allow people to come here if they’re willing to do jobs that Americans aren’t or they’ve got other talents that will improve the country. Research has shown that most undocumented immigrants pay taxes and follow the law. It’s a few bad apples who provide fodder for politicians.

Europe is another story. I see why people there are unhappy because they have a much sturdier social safety net. There is going to be more of an impact, both because of the extent of government services provided, but also because those countries But then you have to consider that people are fleeing Asia and Africa because of colonial systems put in place by the Europeans. 

Scandinavia is seen as a utopia, but there's darkness below the surface in those places. You don’t go from being a place filled with barbarian murderers to everyone holding hands and singing. Humanity is capable of change, but not to that extent. They also tax people at like a 70% rate.

I think that the Swiss private/public hybrid system is the best example we have of how to help our most needy citizens while still allowing people to keep the majority of what they earn. 

The world is a complicated place. Politicians who try to make it seem like there are easy solutions are frauds preying on people who won’t or can’t think for themselves.
