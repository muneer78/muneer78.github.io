My fav weird NBA conspiracy theory is that Lebron left Cleveland the first time because a teammate of his named Delonte West was having an affair with his mom and then actively destroyed Delonte's life.
- He played really terribly in the playoffs after that rumor came out.
- Delonte was later black balled from the NBA and became a homeless drug addict.
- Lebron has never addressed it, but we know he's obsessed with the levers of power.
