A man called in to complain about his car being damaged. He was working at a building where people had to pay for parking. So, this man decided to park in a side street to avoid the fees.

**Man**: They forced me to park in the side street.
**Me**: How do you figure that?
**Man**: I don't want to pay for parking and I have to go to work. It's their fault this happened.
**Me**: Let me get this straight: You chose to park in the side street, and that is your employer's fault?
**Man**: Well, if I hadn't been forced to park there for work, my car would be fine.
**Me**: How do you think things will go for you at work if you sue your employer for damage to your car?
**Man**: What do you mean? Can they fire me?
**Me**: As long as they can prove it's for a non-discriminatory or protected reason, they can fire you. We are in an at-will employment state.
**Man**: That's not fair!
