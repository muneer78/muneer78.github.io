I love the fact that Kamala Harris has shifted the Dems' messaging from "we have to fear Trump and the master plan he has to ruin us" to "look at this weird, doddering old criminal who doesn't ever make sense".

[The Harris Campaign Is Extremely Online. That's Good.](https://bad-faith-times.ghost.io/the-harris-campaign-is-extremely-online-thats-good/?ref=bad-faith-times-newsletter):

> This, as I outlined in a recent BFT piece, is known as a dilemma action: Putting your opponent in a lose-lose situation with a lighthearted and/or mocking strategy. The Harris campaign's excellent posting puts Trump in a dilemma precisely because if he responds to their well-timed taunts, he looks ridiculous while instantly emboldening his opposition. If he doesn't react – a sheer impossibility for the most undisciplined politician in history – then he looks weak and vulnerable. The Harris folks know the Big Boy will lash out. It's why they're posting this shit.

> They've become so accustomed to being the tormenter that they surely never imagined that they could become the tormented. That's precisely what they are today as Harris and Walz make laughingstocks of their opponents...

> Kamala is trolling the trolls. And I say: Keep trolling.
