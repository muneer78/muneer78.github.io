title: More about Baez

Baez's dark powers can counteract anything the Epstein cabal can come with. Dude has repeatedly gotten the guiltiest people freed. I think he's made a real life deal with the devil

Robert Kardashian had a soul. People say that when OJ was declared innocent, Robert K had this look like, "What have I done?" on his face. Baez has never had any remorse when springing the worst of the worst.

Maybe once I retire, I should intern at Baez's firm. It would be like taking the Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts

Bruh! I'd be trying to learn the tricks of the trade and see what types of things are needed to get these rich killers off the hook

Or get a book deal. I'm not picky about where the bread's coming from

I'm thinking I get at least $10 mil for the book, but then I do cult seminars and stuff like that to keep my money up.

I'd have to buy an island lair and then hire 24/7 security. People would be after me. That kind of life takes money
