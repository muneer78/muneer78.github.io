Nicole Cliffe's [post about autism](https://nicole.substack.com/p/a-little-bit-autistic-a-little-bit) hit hard for me. I've felt out of place in the world for most of my personal. I totally get it what it feels like to feel like an alien who is always just slightly abnormal. It's a hard way to live.
