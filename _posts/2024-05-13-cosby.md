I know Bill Cosby is cancelled, but Cosby Show had some iconic moments. There was one where Rudy was singing about "doing it all night long". A very concerned Bill Cosby asks her what she thinks that means and she says something like "Jumping on their bed."

Although given later revelations, maybe I mistook him being dismayed when he was actually intrigued.
