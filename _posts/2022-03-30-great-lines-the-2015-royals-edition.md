Welcome to another baseball season! In honor of this event, here are some great lines about the 2015 Royals.

___

I love this quote from [Grant Brisbee's article](https://www.sbnation.com/2015/7/29/9062795/royals-deadline-zobrist-cueto) about this team:

> They took the momentum into the 2015 season, and they're a fully functional death machine right now.

___

From Joe Sheehan's baseball newsletter:

> The Mets seem to have real edges on both sides of the ball, ones that should be enough to make them the pick. However, they're not managed by a witch. Royals in seven.

___

Finally, a great tweet:
