[Trump TV Hosts At Rally Claim Bible Proves God Saved Trump](https://www.mediaite.com/news/god-was-in-this-trump-tv-hosts-claim-bible-proves-god-saved-trump-in-rant-about-leviticus-and-pig-blood/):

> The duo of Bobby McNeily and Megan Kohler spent the hours before the rally bantering through hours of pro-Trump commentary, including multiple assertions that God saved Trump from being assassinated — a premise that Trump himself has embraced.

> MEGAN KOHLER: Yeah. If anyone was ever doubting that there was divine intervention, if you look at the entire sequence of events and how it all played out, God was in this! God protected President Trump, and he’s going to continue to work through this movement.
