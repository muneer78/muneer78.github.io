From an Instagram post:

> Stop assumng that people are mad at you. Stop attempting to read people's minds. Stop trying to manage the thoughts and emotions of others. Let people be in charge of themselves. If they have something to say to you, they will. And if they don't, it's their responsibility, not yours.
