Humans have to be resilient in the face of adversity.

The following lyric from Big Sean really resonates with me and Emily: 
> "I grew up without a hammock." 

While I wish I'd had a hammock, I didn't. So I had to learn how to make it in the world without that support. And I feel like things aren't as tough when you're going through them. 

It's only when you have the time to reflect that you can say, "Wow. That wasn't great."
