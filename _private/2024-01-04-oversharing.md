Oh for sure. I think I had a tendency to overshare before. I think it's partially what you said above, trying to establish a friendship, but also because no one really listened to me back in the day, so it just all comes out when I feel like someone shows an interest.

Some peeps are definitely not OK with vulnerability. I think it's because they have things about themselves they don't want to face, and seeing us be so open shames them.
