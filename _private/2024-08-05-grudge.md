I've been told by many people that these grudges take up real estate in my brain, that I'm only hurting myself, etc. But, I only think about this stuff when it comes up. It's more like a mental checklist of people who I want to see meet negative ends.

Like there was this guy in high school who liked to bully me. Like 18 years later, I saw that he and his dad had been indicted by the Feds for loan fraud. Never really thought about the dude, but it closed the chapter for me to see that happen. Plus, he looks like he's smoked 3 packs a day since we were in gym class together.
