From various Instagram posts:

> Everybody is shocked when you start being real serious about boundaries like yeah surprise, I'm not a people pleaser anymore so let's see how cool we really are.

> My side of the story doesn't matter anymore. Life happened, I healed but most importantly I learned who deserves a seat at my table and who will never sit at it again.

> Sometimes as an adult you have to decide "this is the last time these people are gonna make me feel this way" & stand on it. Rather that be family, a relationship or a friendship.

> Unfortunately, I don't want to rebuild bonds I didn't break. You crossed the line & I didn't, so I'm good.
