[From Threads](https://www.threads.net/@julievoth/post/DAZQFnyTNWy):

> I feel like the people in my life cannot comprehend what it’s like to “meet yourself” for the first time at 29 years old.
> Like - getting my ADHD diagnosis & recognizing that many of my debilitating traits also align with autism (seeking assessment, not diagnosed) is changing my entire life.
> It’s not just about having a name for it - it feels like someone (finally) gave me the answers I need to actually *live my life.*
>
> I HUGELY downplayed how debilitating my symptoms have been by modifying my life to make it look like these don’t exist -
> 
> Like I literally built my whole identity around my coping modifications so people couldn’t separate them,
> Because I couldn’t find an explanation for why I was different, so I had to find a way to hide it as deeply as possible.
> I *do* share values and authentic expressions with the modifications, but not *completely.* ⬇️
> 
> It was enough that I didn’t feel like a complete imposter, but not authentic to me in that I was literally using coping mechanisms as an identity/persona.
> And we aren’t our coping mechanisms. So much got repressed/neglected to make that work. And so much shame and self-abuse went into maintaining the image.
> Growing up, ND people were hugely stigmatized and to protect myself from the pain of being different I felt I HAD to deny any differences - so I had to resist looking at this as an option.
> 
> I’m glad I stopped though (it was actually people sharing threads like this one ⬆️ that helped me open up to my doctor for a second evaluation - because I just did not trust my first one.)
> Because for all of these years I just did NOT know how to human - and no one around me can understand what that feels like - to live like that, especially for a prolonged time.
> It led me to substance abuse, self-harm, ideation, and many very harmful and nearly irreversible choices.
> 
> Because it is literally MADDENING to be a human and not know how to “be a human.” So you’re just acting all the time and desperately trying to get your needs met with this really unnatural behavior.
> But you don’t know what your needs even ARE because they’re not the same as other people’s - as was made obvious by my repeated attempt to fulfill common “needs” for myself and it didn’t make even a drop of a difference for me.
> And now - with a diagnosis and a possible explanation for the rest -
> 
> For the first time in
> >>> nearly thirty years <<<
> I have answers to questions I’ve been asking since I can remember.
> And I have vocabulary I can research that plain-as-day describes what I’m going through, how that contrasts to a “typical” experience, and ways to actually *thrive* with these differences.
> Like - not only do I have potential, I have a pathway for fulfilling it.
> I can *feel* normal in my body and mind (understanding, accepting, working with vs against.)
> 
> And it is absolutely life changing. And there’s so much grief with it, too.
> And no one in my immediate world has any understanding of how damaging this dynamic was, or how it has *literally saved my life* to have these answers.
> Even if the assessment turns up that I do not have autism, understanding the traits and how to address them is just.
> I feel like I awoke from hell. Literally. And was born into a life of understanding and potential and existing as I am.
> 
> It’s HUGE. And I’m posting because yall are why I stepped out and said something, so maybe yall will get it…
> Or maybe Threads will bury this but at least it’s out of my brain. :)
> 
> And when I say life saving - every day for at least the past 15+ years, I’ve known I was going to eventually give up on life.
> Eventually, it wouldn’t be worth it. Or worse, I’d live to 80+ and feel like that for 65+ years. Literal hell.
> But I knew it wasn’t “just depression” - the depression was an emotional reaction to the underlying issues that kept getting explained away as “anxiety,” “depression,” “fibromyalgia,” etc.
> Finding the answer has completely erased this feeling. Completely. 😭❤️
