While driving home from buying a new car with my wife:

It was the gentlest braking she's ever done. It is honestly the first time she's driven that I haven't felt like we were about to hit the stopped cars at an intersection.

I was like, "What just happened here?" She's like, "What??"
"Were the brakes on your old cars not working correctly?"
"I'm babying the car!!"
"Wow. I didn't think this was something you were capable of. I thought the rest of my life, I was doomed to be afraid of hitting every car that's stopped while you're driving."
"DON'T ACT SO SURPRISED!!!!"
"Well, bravo to you. Now that I know this is a personal choice and not a genetic defect, I urge you to continue with this path towards gentler driving."

She then flipped me off. ðŸ˜„
