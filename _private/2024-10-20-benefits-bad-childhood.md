She can sense when people are hiding something from her, and her reading of the power dynamics in any room comes as if by instinct.

The skills needed to navigate her turbulent childhood appear to serve her well as an adult.

> As an adult, though, Steve has proven to be highly flexible, with a willingness to take significant risks with little hesitation. He is sure that his upbringing has helped him through rough career patches. When facing big questions—where to work or how much to invest in a relationship—he has a high tolerance for ambiguity, for living in that in-between stage in which one does not know whether success or crushing failure awaits.

Meanwhile, those from stressful backgrounds may be quicker to explore other possibilities and stumble upon novel solutions.

> "I had no difficulty doing this," she says. "I counted on the permanence of nothing in my life except my ability to meet the challenge of change."
