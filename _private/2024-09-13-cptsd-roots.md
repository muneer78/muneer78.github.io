[From Threads](https://www.threads.net/@x.x_.chesska._x.x/post/CxI3p2lLDKj):

> Having CPSTD I can remember the day, where I was at, roughly how old I was ( child.)
> When that seed of CPSTD took root. I remember the pain of that small child crying out to a imagined "god" figure. Asking WHY.
> Why did you put me on this earth if I was just made to suffer. WHY was I made so incorrect.
> I wished for the final end. I prayed for it.
> Then I remember the feelings that washed over me as I felt. I wasn't going make it out of that house alive, it would be because of them.
> 
> I had no one. There was no one to help or protect, to believe a child who said many times. Trying to get any adult to listen SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT WITH MY MOM. MY MOM IS NOT NORMAL.
> The brush off I would receive. I was made to be the scapegoat. I was made to be seen as crazy so you would never believe the crazy horrible truths.
> That is when CPSTD took it's full hold. Not that anything was normal before, but surely hasn't been "normal" since. While I know I no longer in the that place, those people are far gone. I have gone no contact. However I am still trapped in my own mind at times in a prison only I fully know & understand.
