From an Instagram post:

> Some of the kindest souls I know have lived in a world that was not so kind to them. Some of the best human beings I know have been through so much at the hands of others, and they still love deeply, they still care. Sometimes, it's the people who have been hurt the most who refuse to be hardened in this world, be- cause they would never want to make another person feel the same way they have felt. If that isn't something to be in awe of, I don't know what is.
