This is beyond creepy.

[The Lifelong Guilt Trip of Abstinence Pledges and Purity Balls](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-lifelong-guilt-trip-of-abstinence-pledges-and-purity-balls):

> Pastor Ron Johnson, who has five daughters under a purity vow, said exactly the same thing to ABC News when one of his daughters was asked what she says to people who want to know if she has a boyfriend: “You told them you have a boyfriend. It’s your dad.” 

> To follow, her whole youth group was subjected to numerous sermons and Sunday School lessons on abstinence, an education that even seeped into her everyday school life. “My school had a special week called ‘ABC: Abstinence Best Choice,’” she explains. “During it, we had someone come speak to us. She took a piece of flash paper, lit it on fire and said, ‘This is what happens when you have sex.’ I still don’t really know what she was getting at with that demonstration. We also did a thing with tape where you stick it to each person’s arm and then show that it’s not sticky anymore — that was somehow also what happened when you had sex.” 

> Marie says the pressure was on the girls, since it was understood that boys were “wired” differently.

> Marriage, though, was far from a panacea. “On our wedding night, we attempted sex for the first time and I started crying and he stopped. I ran and locked myself in the bathroom. I was so ashamed he would know I wasn’t virgin.” Delaney then told her husband about the sexual assaults, after which they tried to have sex again. “We sort of accomplished it. But then the guilt hit. I felt dirty. I felt evil. Then I called my dad and apologized for having sex WITH MY HUSBAND ON MY WEDDING NIGHT.”
