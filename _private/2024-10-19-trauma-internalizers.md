From an Instagram post:

> If there's anything internalizers have in common, it's their need to share their inner experience. As children, their need for genuine emotional connection is the central fact of their existence. Nothing hurts their spirit more than being around someone who won't engage with them emotionally. A blank face kills something in them. They read people closely, looking for signs that they've made a connection. This isn't a social urge, like wanting people to chat with; it's a powerful hunger to connect heart to heart with a like-minded person who can understand them. They find nothing more exhilarating than clicking with someone who gets them. When they can't make that kind of connection, they feel emotional loneliness.
