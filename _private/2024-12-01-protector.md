From an Instagram post:

> Were YOU the protector who needed safety?
>
> You knew as a child that your role was to be a "little adult." To hide how you felt, to ignore your needs, and to keep it all together for everyone else around you.
>
> The adults around you didn't show up for you and you were put in a position where your childhood wasn't play. 
> 
> It was work.
> 
> You never got the support and love to know you were valued for who you are, not what you do. So your adult life is an exhausting pattern of repeating the same cycle...
>
> Of peffectionism, anxiety, codependency, and a history of taking love in the form of breadcrumbs. A part ofyou is still that little girl who thinks it is your responsibility to fix everyone and everything around you. 
>
> You tell yourself you're independent. You take pride in making it work, no matter what. But you don't talk about how broken your heart actually is. How much it hurts to not be able to trust.
> 
> How deep down, you want to be protected...
>
> For once.
> 
> You want someone to show up for you in the way that no one ever did. For someone to notice the invisible emotional burden you've carried and say, "1'm here for you now. You can put this down."
> 
> The truth is: you are who you've been looking for.
> 
> You know in your heart it's time to learn it's no longer your job to fix, be perfect, or neglect yourself to be what others need.
> 
> You are the person who woke up from the generational cycle. Who wants better. Who knows that she can grieve her childhood and build a new future for herself...
>
> And you will.
