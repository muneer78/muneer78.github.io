Women are playing into patriarchy by doing OnlyFans. It's framed as empowering, but is it really? At the end of the day, you're making money and getting validation from dudes. Which I thought was what empowerment was trying to eliminate.

This stuff is also saved somewhere forever.

If you have kids, you think some clever bullies won't find mom's old OF videos? I guess this is also the issue for women who posed in PB back in the day. I listened to a podcast where a woman said she's told her teen son not to Google her name under any circumstances.

But you know someone on the playground already showed him all the pics.

I also maintain that Bumble (whichever app is the one where women talk first) is anti-feminist and places women into the role of commodity for the dudes on the app.
