[Athlete Run-In: Kirk Hinrich, Gryffindor](https://deadspin.com/athlete-run-in-kirk-hinrich-gryffindor-143113/):

> I have a good friend whose roommate is a bit of a sloot. She is originally from Pittsburgh and has done the party in my pants dance with a couple of Steelers. Not long ago we were out at a bar in Chicago, and Kirk and his buddies were hitting on her pretty hard. She honestly had no idea who he was and must have told him to get a life two or three times. Then he pulled the whole, "Do you know who I am?" line. Swear to God. I've been around professional athletes a ton, and I've actually never heard one use this until that night.
