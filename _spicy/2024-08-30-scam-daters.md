Saw a Reddit video on YouTube where a dude went on a first date. Woman brings a friend and they both order surf and turf and tons of drinks. The waiter then asks how the bill is going to be split and one of the women says it'll all be in one check. That they expect the dude to pay for. 

Man, if a woman did that to me, I’d be like, “You two ever seen each other naked? Well, you about to.”
