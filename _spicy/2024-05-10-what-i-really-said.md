[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a4exf8/comment/ebefy8x/) from Reddit is epic:

> I had recess duty a few years ago. A kindergarten girl came running over with another girl right after her and said “She called me the b-word.” When I asked the second student if she called the first student the b-word, she turned to the first one and said “Motherfucker doesn’t start with a b.”
>
> I managed to turn my laugh into a cough, but yeah no more recess for her that day.
>
> Edited to add: I don’t think the first girl even realized motherfucker was a swear so she was focused on the word “bitch.”
