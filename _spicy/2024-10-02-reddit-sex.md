[What was the hottest thing someone said to you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tvvges/what_was_the_hottest_thing_someone_said_to_you/):

> I was fucking my wife when she said "Roll over, I want to taste my pussy on your cock".

> “Fuck me like you paid for it.”

> "I need your kids in my cervix"

> F me so hard that when you leave me I want to slash your tires.

> “My pussy is starting to hurt, put it in my ass and cum!” my wife on our 3rd session that day.
>
> “I’m going to make you cum in my mouth and then keep sucking until you cum again” and she did…
>
> Giving me a handjob, she laid her head on my chest and asked if I though I could hit her face when I came. I did and she squealed in delight.
>
> “Holy shit you kicked my ass” from a 30 something divorced mom of three. I was 22 at the time and had just pounded her relentlessly for 20 minutes. Later she said she walked funny for a few days.

> "i love the taste of myself" as she slid off of me to blow me.

> But, there was one time I was on top of my ex (missionary) and started out slow, but a little forceful. Each time I thrust, this open-mouth smile of ecstasy would show on her face. Then, she wrapped her arms around my neck, pulled herself up, kissed me and looked me right in my eyes. I paused briefly, somewhat confused. Then, she said "faster. harder." and brought me down with her. I was all too happy to oblige.

> Fuck my ass harder!

[Whats the kinkiest/dirtiest thing someone said to you during sex?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRedditAfterDark/comments/1dh3hpc/whats_the_kinkiestdirtiest_thing_someone_said_to/):

> “I fucking hate you” while he was thrusting deep into my pussy - it was a hate fuck needless to say he actually loved fucking me

> ... he told me how hot it was that I said “shut up and fuck me harder” when he asked if it was hurting.

> First ever hookup with a girl in college I’d met that same day. We’re in my bed taking our time exploring, and she groans, “Pull my hair.”
> 
> I reach up while kissing on her clavicle, grab a handful her hair just above the scalp at the back above her neck and give a lusty prolonged tug, which makes her moan louder.
> 
> Then she pulls my head up, and hisses in my ear, “Not that hair.”
