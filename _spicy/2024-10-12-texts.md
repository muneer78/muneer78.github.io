> (770): (rec'v)Have you set boundaries with him yet? 
> (sent) lets see..he talks to me only in innuendos...makes out with me in random places...and his hands basically stay between my legs..and supposedly I am on his "to-do list"...I'll go with no on this one...

---

> (650): so Mike and I made a deal. we'd do anal if he would help me pick out carpet tomorrow. 
> (415): What...you let him do that? 
> (650): It wasnt that bad. the two minutes it took is nothing compared to the 10 hr day I have planned for him tomorrow

---

> (503): Condoms? Check. Glitter? Check. Fuck me pumps? Double check. Dignity? No where to be found. I'm about to homewreck the shit out of that dumb bitch. 
> (360): I've been meaning to talk to you about your lack of self-respect these days and the toll it's taking on your vagina.

> (781): She said she didn't have time to shave "there" (617): Then she shouldn't have had time to order the lobster.

---

> (704): He crawled in my bed this morning, ate me out, and even brought me a panera deli sammie for lunch at school. I don't care what he lied about, all is forgiven him.

> (+44): It's horrible of you to say your above all this when the bar uses your drunk picture to scare people.

---

> (404): He asked if I wanted to leave my bra on while we were doing it from behind bc he read somewhere that all that pounding can be painful for big breasts. THAT thoughtful.

---

> (630): I think im gonna have to stop sexting on the metra. The middle aged businessman behind me just leaned over and whispered 'dirty girl' and highfived his seatmate.

---

> (914): We had a long talk in which he told me he respects me more than any other girl. 30 minutes later, I got a facial.

> There is an old man sitting across from me. Phone rang and his ringtone is children giggling, I'm not safe here.

> (516): I wish "capable of destroying an innocent girl's life" is something I could put on my resume

---

> (510): i am high, trapped with a bunch of skaters and asians watching a cat on lsd on youtube, the girl on the couch next to me is getting fingered, and there is lady gaga playing. god has forgetten about me
