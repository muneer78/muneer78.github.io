I was listening to Shannon Sharpe's podcast. 

He said he was out on a date at a restaurant his rookie year. He was ready to order, but she was really studying the menu. He asked what she was having trouble with. 

She replied, "I'm trying to figure out what goes with lobster". Shannon looks at her and said "Condoms". He said straight up that if she ordered the lobster, she better be ready for sex that night. Needless to say, she didn't order the lobster and he never saw her again.
