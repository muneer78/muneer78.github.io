## The New Full-Frontal: Has Pubic Hair in America Gone Extinct?

Meet Sophia Pinto: the 21st century's standard-issue, all-American perfect 10.

The 5-foot-5 Minnesota native -- a sly, funny, 22-year-old natural blonde who spends every summer bikini-clad on the shores of Lake Minnetonka -- works out five days a week. Her slim waist and megawatt smile hearken back to the polyvinyl glamour of the original Barbie doll.

In fact, if Mattel were to redesign Barbie based on the new millennium's ideal woman, she would likely resemble Pinto. Healthy, athletic, alluring, and smart (Pinto will graduate early this month from Northwestern University), she's both a role model and a sex symbol.

And if you were to undress Pinto, you'd find she embodies yet another trademark characteristic of the plastic glamour girl-turned-careerwoman: Like Barbie, Pinto has no pubic hair.

Jodi Staiman, an esthetician, administers between five and 10 Brazilian waxes per week (and even more in the summertime and just before Halloween).

Every four to five weeks, the East Asian Studies major undergoes a cosmetic procedure known as a Brazilian wax. An esthetician pours wax heated to 140° F (roughly the temperature of a steak fresh off the grill) onto her labia and spreads it like butter on bread. Half a minute later, she swiftly peels away the hardened wax -- and with it, a full crop of pubic hair, freshly ripped from the follicles.

If you're squeamishly wondering how much the college senior gets paid for submitting to these weird acts of perverse, pornographic violence, brace yourself for the truly agonizing part: It's actually Pinto who shells out the cash, paying her regular waxer, Anna, more than $65 every time. But it beats the ingrown hairs and razor bumps that come from shaving, she says.

Sound excruciating? Sure is, says Pinto, who pops two Advil before each appointment. But grooming habits like hers hardly raise an eyebrow among the under-30 set. Today, it's all but commonplace for women to go to extreme measures to get bald, pre-pubescent nether regions: Indiana University researchers Debby Herbenick and Vanessa Schick found in a recent study that nearly 60 percent of American women between 18 and 24 are sometimes or always completely bare down there, while almost half of women in the U.S. between 25 and 29 reported similar habits. Herbenick's numbers show a clear-cut trend: More women lack pubic hair than ever before.

What's happening to America's vaginas? Is pubic hair going extinct?

In a word, no. But it's on the fast track to the endangered species list, and its chief predators include the porn industry, smaller bathing suits and lingerie bottoms, and the Kardashian sisters (case in point: Kim once famously proclaimed that women "shouldn't have hair anywhere but their heads").

Pubic hair is, however, evolving. Once upon a time, all vulvas were coated in a protective layer of coarse, woolly tresses. Hard to believe, right? It's kind of like the revelation that horses once had toes, or that the Ford Mustang once had tailfins. But like any evolving species, the vulva has morphed into something sleeker, starker, and altogether more modern. Today, it is smooth, baby-soft, and hairless.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HAIR DOWN THERE

The most staggering aspect of the bald-vulva phenomenon is just how quickly women (and men) have embraced it.

Less than two decades ago, the idea of "taking it all off" seemed painful, unnecessary, and even vaguely fetishistic; As recently as 1996, one harrowing, particularly memorable vignette from Eve Ensler's groundbreaking play The Vagina Monologues effectively turned the idea of removing pubic hair at the request of a sexual partner into something cringe-worthy and perverted. Trimming away a few strays during swimsuit season was one thing, but removing all the hair from one's genitals, effectively turning back the clock on puberty? Traumatizing. Selfish. Inhumane, even.

Or not. Enter the seven Padilha sisters, immigrants from Brazil. In 1987, Jocely, Jonice, Janea, Joyce, Jussara, Juracy, and Judseia Padilha opened the appropriately named J. Sisters salon in Midtown Manhattan, where they began offering what they had dubbed the "Brazilian wax." Years before, a woman in a thong swimsuit with an ungroomed bikini line had strolled by Janea Padilha as she lay on the beach. Why not just wax the full bikini line, she wondered. The peculiar practice would go on to change the world of female genitalia as we know it -- but not for another decade or so. Instead, it would remain weird, taboo, and rarely administered for another 13 years.

Then, in 2000, one groundbreaking episode of Sex And The City made the Manolo Blahnik demographic sit up and take notice: Heroine Carrie Bradshaw found a new swagger in her step after waxing it off. And once Carrie was bare down there ... well, remember when the Sex And The City girls ate cupcakes? Let's put it this way: There's now a cupcake bakery on every other corner in upper Manhattan. Finally, the phenomenon introduced by the seven sisters Padilha blossomed, as spas all over the United States began to offer Brazilian wax services.

By 2003, Victoria Beckham had announced that she thought Brazilian waxes should be compulsory at age 15. Eva Longoria followed suit in 2006, telling Cosmopolitan that "Every woman should try a Brazilian wax once. The sex they have afterward will make them keep coming back." Soon, states like New Jersey and North Dakota were revisiting their regulations on legal cosmetology services after outcries from women who were surprised and dismayed to find that genital waxing had never been officially legalized. Gone were the warm, velvety vaginas of yesteryear -- the smooth, Brazilian-waxed vagina was the wave of the future.

THE EMPEROR'S NEW PRIVATE PARTS

Or was it? Most women don't chat about their vulvas in everyday life, so any concepts of "normal" pubic hair have always been murky and widely varied to begin with. Alanna, who asked that we refrain from using her last name, is just part of a whole generation who feels she's been duped by a certain everybody's doing it, everybody loves it myth.

Earlier this year, the 21-year-old New Jersey native's first full Brazilian wax (and last, she vows) left her smarting in more ways than one. "A lot of girls in my sorority had been saying it was the only way to go, so I thought it was going to be this life-changing thing. This magical cure-all for all my problems down there. I was a little mistaken," she says. "I was a little misled."

In addition to paying $55 for a hair removal job that wasn't nearly as thorough as she'd hoped, her suddenly pre-pubescent private parts simply gave her the creeps. "I'm not a fan of looking like a 12-year-old," Alanna says. "I think people should have hair down there. Our ancestors grew it for a reason. For protection." (To be fair, scientists don't actually know why humans have pubic hair. Some think it's to help trap pheromones, which connects us subconsciously to people we're attracted to; others, meanwhile, think it's simply there to keep our precious cargo warm enough for successful reproduction.)

Even if Alanna had set out on a noble quest to uncover the truth about "normal" pubic hair, she may still have come up empty-handed: Actual studies on American women's pubic hair removal habits are few and far between.

What surveys have been conducted, however, tend to support what most of America already suspects: that Brazilian waxing is largely practiced among the young, white, heterosexual Sex And The City and Gossip Girl demographics.

Herbenick's studies have found that women under 30 are two to three times as likely to have no pubic hair than women over 30. And Jodi Staiman, an esthetician at the posh Asha Salon in Evanston, Illinois, confirms: The vast majority of her Brazilian wax clients are under 30, and "a good 80 to 85 percent" are in their twenties. (That's not to say, though, that older women don't ever go bare. Pinto's mother, a 56-year-old divorcée, is now a regular Brazilian wax customer, thanks to her daughter.)

Staiman, who administers between five and 10 Brazilian waxes per week (and even more in the summertime and just before Halloween), also notes that her clientele is overwhelmingly white and Asian. Over the last six months, she adds, "I think I've done about eight Brazilian waxes on African-Americans, total." While Evanston and its nearby Northwestern University have disproportionately white and Asian populations, Staiman also credits the low number of black women in her clientele to the fact that coarser hair is more painful to remove by waxing.

Full pubic hair removal, according to Herbenick's studies, is most common among sexually active women, and specifically women who report having frequent oral sex and women who are not in monogamous relationships.

But women sport a stark-naked mons veneris for many reasons, ranging from the practical to the provocative. Herbenick's explanation is a tame one: She thinks it's mainly a response to skimpy clothing trends. "Our underwear today is a lot smaller than women's underwear was 20 years ago," she says. "And if you have hair sticking out the sides of your underwear, that's just kind of, like, unkempt."

Low-slung pants, too, may be a factor: "Certainly when I think of the younger version of Britney Spears and the extremely low-cut jeans she would wear, I remember thinking, If she had pubic hair you would be able to see it," she says.

Pinto's reasoning, too, is more sensible than scandalous: She just feels cleaner down there.

"It could be attributed to visual pornographers' desire to infantilize women, or simply to make genitalia more visible to the camera."

"I work out a lot. I get sweaty," she explains calmly. "And it starts to smell when you've got hair down there. So yeah, it hurts, but I just feel so much cleaner."

Pinto, who's candid about her active sex life, points out that she's never waxed at the request of a boyfriend or a partner. "I did it the first time for me," she says, "and I still do it for me." Pinto was 17 when she first waxed it all off.

Though Pinto says sex has never felt any different to her without pubic hair ("Once we get going, who cares?" she says with a laugh), there certainly remains a sexual motive for taking it all off: Drawing back the curtain of pubic hair exposes the clitoris, the labia and the vagina for plain viewing. There's a tactile element, too: As one elated young husband named Mark explained to Glamour in 2009, "The skin down there is protected -- it never really touches anything, it never sees the sun -- so it's ridiculously soft.

"You can't really tell how soft it is until a woman waxes. Oh my God, you can't believe how soft it is when you wax," 28-year-old Mark gushed. "It's extremely, extremely soft, so it feels great when you have sex."

Pinto's past boyfriends, she says, would wholeheartedly agree. "Once, I started dating someone when I hadn't waxed in a while," she says, "And then when I did, he went, Oh! This is awesome! Why didn't you do this before?!"

"That was my senior year of high school," she adds. "So every month I would text him, 'Guess who's getting a wax!' And he'd be like, 'Smiley face, so excited!'"

Many men, like Bob Fitzpatrick, a finance student at the University of Michigan, are more likely to perform oral sex on a female partner if she has no pubic hair.

"If she's seeking for you to pleasure her and you have pubic hairs in your mouth, you're not going to be pleased with that," the 21-year-old says. Fitzpatrick, a bright, chatty Lake Forest, Illinois, native who's paired off with a casual-but-exclusive significant other, says he prefers a clean-shaven or fully waxed mons pubis, and giggles as he recalls one particularly dismaying encounter. "I was like, Oh no, five o'clock shadow?! This is gonna be itchy on my face!"

Although sex, hygiene, and clothing are all contributing factors, Fitzpatrick, Herbenick, and Pinto all agree that there's one main driving force behind America's villainization of pubic hair: pornography.

When a team of researchers from George Washington University took a closer look at Playboy's representations of women's genitalia throughout the years, they found that in issues dating from the magazine's inception in 1953 up through the 1970s and '80s, more than 95 percent of the centerfolds and naked models sported full, apparently natural pubic hair.

In the late 20th century, though, that changed. As Joseph Slade, professor of media and culture at Ohio University, puts it, the media legitimized voyeurism and turned it into a way of life; suddenly, porn viewers wanted to see everything more deeply and without the veil of hair. Thus, Playboy's love affair with the au naturel look faded: By the 1990s, more than a third of the models appeared to have removed some of their pubic hair. And in the new millennium, less than 10 percent of nude models now sport the full pubic bush, while a third remove their hair partially and one-quarter remove it completely. Playboy has trimmed down the standard from the un-modified, detail-obscuring "fur bikini" it helped popularize in the 1960s to the vanishing act it promotes today.

Hugh Hefner's magazine, however, isn't the only supporter of the tress-less treasure chest. Rather, says Slade, genital alopecia seems to have hit the entire adult entertainment industry. "Depilation took hold in visual porn in the 1990s, though some actresses trimmed for movies before then," Slade says. "It was easier to keep crotches cleaner on the set. But certainly the practice is widespread in video porn today. Enough so that backlash has created a niche fetish for 'full bushes.'"

But while the sleek, slick, bare labia majora is more common in visual porn today than ever before, the stylized hairless vulva has actually been around for centuries. According to Slade, as far back as the 15th century, women -- especially prostitutes -- often shaved their pubic hair to avoid lice infestation, which is where having a muff may have picked up its stigma of being "unclean." In the years following, medieval and classical European sculptors and painters omitted pubic hair from depictions of female nudes; In fact, the notion of pubic hair in general was so unholy that every last naked prophet on the Sistine Chapel ceiling is completely hairless below the neck. But life didn't dare imitate art -- at least, that is, not until Playboy.

Slade cites two potential reasons for porn's fixation on the bare vagina. "It could be attributed to visual pornographers' desire to infantilize women," Slade says, "or simply to make genitalia more visible to the camera. Male porn stars often shave their pubic hair for that purpose, too."

Many feminists understandably take umbrage at the first, Slade says. "Bare pubic areas are most common in videos advertised as featuring young women, because it does infantilize them or make them look pre-pubescent." It's less common, he says, in porn featuring MILFs (American Pie's now-famous acronym for "mothers I'd like to fuck"), because mature age is the appeal.

THE CULT OF THE SPHYNX

Herbenick and Fitzpatrick both believe one demographic group has embraced the hairless-cat look more fervently than others: college students.

In theory, this should come as no surprise; The average U.S. state university actually has all the right features to act as a veritable incubator for anti-pube sentiments. Where else do youth, skimpy clothing, rampantly available pornography, and non-monogamous sexual habits all converge so gloriously?

And as anyone who's ever lived in a freshman dormitory can attest, close quarters and newfound autonomy can produce an open forum for frank, peer-to-peer conversations about sex that would be less likely to arise in other adult settings. In other words, a conversation about pubic hair is more likely to come up in a frat house basement than at an office water cooler.

"If they want to take it off, they take it off. If they want to grow it back, they grow it back. But they're doing it because they want to."

Sometimes, those basements can act as warm, fertile petri dishes for the spread of contagious (and mostly unfounded) negativity. "Guys sit around and they talk about sex, and they think they're supposed to say, 'Pubic hair's disgusting,' and 'I hate pubic hair,'" he says. "They don't want to be judged for their sexual preferences."

And among women, Herbenick says, pubic grooming habits and preferences tend to spread among friend groups -- which leads to "clumps," she says, of women with similar grooming regimens. "Friends talk," she says. "So especially among teenagers and college students, when everyone is trying to be the same, 'the same' is what you get."

Herbenick recalls one encounter in which a popular, well-liked college student in a class she taught openly professed that he had never hooked up with a girl who had pubic hair, and would frankly be disgusted to undress a woman and discover a veil of genital fur.

"Some girls talked to me and wrote in their papers that they had always had pubic hair, and in a couple cases never did anything to their pubic hair," she said. "They never thought it was a problem. But when he said that, they went home and changed it. They really started to feel ashamed about their bodies."

Fitzpatrick, similarly, finds himself in a collegiate scene full of young women far too obsessed with the hair down there. "It becomes a compulsion," he says.

Fitzpatrick's female friends, especially those who confess to not having waxed in a while, have added a distinct new routine to their social calendars: weekend-evening freak-outs. "When they go out on a Friday night to the bar, if they think they might be having sex with somebody later, they're like, 'Is he gonna judge me? What is he gonna think?'" Fitzpatrick says. Other non-waxed coeds simply skip the bar altogether.

Pinto, too, admits that she gets nervous about having sex toward the third or fourth week after getting a wax. "If I haven't waxed and I suddenly end up hooking up with someone, I'm like, Oh, God. No, no!" she says.

And it's true, says Fitzpatrick: Guys can be, and often are, "absolutely brutal." It's not uncommon for a college-aged man to "go out of his way" to make fun of a girl's pubic grooming habits with his buddies after he's hooked up with her -- even if he's never expressed a preference one way or the other, he says. "Then all of a sudden, instead of just being a girl who's had a fun night with her respective guy, she becomes that girl who has weird pubic hair. And nobody wants that label."

But while university campuses may be hotbeds of body-hair negativity, individual college students' attitudes seem remarkably different behind closed doors.

"I personally find myself a little more attractive when I don't have it," Pinto explains. "But one time I had a consistent hookup and he told me, 'Either way, you're attractive. You're a naked girl, and you're in my bed. Doesn't matter.'"

Fitzpatrick, too, downplays the actual make-or-break importance of a woman's pubic hairstyle. "Back in the Victorian age, it was sexy to be really pale because it meant you didn't work in the fields," he says. "Or it was sexy to be fat because it meant you could afford to eat lots of meals."

Similarly, Fitzpatrick says, the waxed or clean-shaven vulva should be seen as little more than a fad -- albeit something of a saddening one. "At first, the powers that be tell you it's sexy, and then by the time you're done, you have a bunch of women obsessively waxing themselves."

"When I first met some of my friends," he adds, "they were like, 'Oh, I only like girls with 34D's who are six feet tall,' and run down this list of high standards. And then a year or two later, once I'd gotten to know them, those same guys were like, 'Yeah, you know, I really don't mind that she wears granny panties.'"

EMPOWERING OR DEFLOWERING?

Herbenick readily admits that today, both men and women alike largely consider pubic hair dirty or unfeminine. In other words, it carries a less-than-desirable stigma among members of both sexes. "But I would put it this way: so does the rest of women's body hair," she counters. "Pubic hair was kind of the last to join." After all, she says, women remove their leg hair and underarm hair all over the Western world, and many report that they would feel ashamed or embarrassed if they didn't. "They wouldn't want people to see that on them," she says. "They say they would feel unfeminine, or that they wouldn't feel sexy."

So what does it all mean? Is pubic hair removal a symbol of feminine pride, something that Gloria Steinem might be proud of? Or does it signify submission to a domineering male agenda?

"It's all in how people deal with it," Herbenick says. As she's seen in her lecture-hall encounters, the hairless vulva isn't always analogous to the clenched fist of female solidarity; just as often, it's a telltale sign of oppression or forced conformity.

But, she says, uncovered, demystified genitalia can just as easily be a symbol of empowerment. "Many women have started to feel a sense of ownership over their bodies -- an autonomy," she says. "If they want to take it off, they take it off. If they want to grow it back, they grow it back. If they want to shave it into a heart, they shave it into a heart. But they're doing it because they want to."

And sometimes, they want to make it permanent. Women aren't just striving for ways to attain that smooth, glossy, doll-like physique -- they're looking for ways to preserve it, too. Many advocate for laser hair removal as a quick, one-size-fits-all cure for the chronic problem of body hair; Pinto, who's already permanently depilated her forearms via laser hair removal, plans to undergo the procedure on her bikini area this winter.

Laser hair removal requires commitment: It can take eight to 12 half-hour sessions to completely remove the hair, with three to eight weeks between each treatment, and maintenance sessions are often necessary in later years to keep growth at bay.

Pinto's mother, a former plastic surgeon, plans to give her daughter the $3,000 procedure as a college graduation gift.

## The 'Wide Open and Unregulated' Marketing of Vaginal Cosmetic Surgery

Women seeking a "designer vagina" are increasingly misled and misinformed.

Jan Michellardi/Flickr

Every girl has that time in her life when, either out of boredom, curiosity, or something more deeply rooted in bodily dissatisfaction, she Googles her options for "altering her vulval morphology."

A new study in BMJ Open looks at how providers are responding to women's curiosity -- or playing off their insecurities -- by advertising the medical procedure online. Mimicking what someone familiar with these procedures from pop culture might do, the researchers entered the search term "designer vagina" into Google and studied the first ten U.S. and U.K. providers to pop up.

The types of -- medically unnecessary -- procedures falling under the category of female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS) included hymenoplasty, labiaplasty, "G-spot" amplication, and vaginal "rejuvenation" (the study's authors chose to put those certain words in quotations).

Unfortunately, like Pete Well's review of Guy Fieri's new Times Square restaurant, the researchers rated the information provided by clinicians offering such services as being overwhelmingly "poor."

The justifications offered to potential patients range from promises of "revirgination" to a multi-faceted "Mommy Makeover." They appeal to a larger culture of rejuvenation, with one site explaining: "A woman might have a face lift and look really young until she goes to bed and a partner can see the evidence of ageing there."

They're also clear about where the insecurity that might lead women to seek out vaginoplasty is coming from: Sure, women with enlarged labia might be uncomfortable wearing tight clothing or riding horses, to the point where the surgery is medically warranted. But the sites also are candid in admitting that sexual partners, along with increased exposure to nudity in the media, often bring women's attention to a problem that they weren't even aware existed. Surgery, various clinicians promise, can improve "disharmony and resentment " in relationships and allow the patient to "feel like a real woman again."

Meanwhile, the only two sites to offer success rates boasted of 95 to 100 percent patient satisfaction. But when a procedure is done for entirely cosmetic reasons, "success" is a necessarily subjective outcome. All ten mentioned risks (which do tend to be minimal), but little long or short-term detail was provided. Some insisted that pregnancy is much riskier. None of the sites mentioned lower age limits, which the authors highlight as being especially problematic, as concerns about looking "normal" down there might be especially distressing for young women.

They also found a lot of instances of what they interpreted as these sites using subtle tricks to convince women that they had a problem requiring surgical intervention in the first place. The sites tend to call attention to "labial hypertrophy," for example, which is not a medically defined condition. They also argue that the frequent use of references to odor, ugliness, and irritation were likely intended to cause women to feel bad about their vaginas, and thus experience their "symptoms" as worse than they otherwise might.

"The absence of evidence for clinical effectiveness was not only left out," the authors concluded, "but in combination the sites actually made scientiﬁcally inaccurate claims that the procedures were effective along physical, psychological, social and sexual parameters."

There's no denying that the researchers are coming at this from a decidedly anti-vaginoplasty perspective. They emphasize non-invasive ways of minimizing genital discomfort, and argue that self-consciousness or lack of sexual confidence are best addressed by psychologists, not surgeons. "Providers," they insist, "should emphasize that healthy vulvas come in all shapes, sizes and colors, that all vulval appearances are compatible with psychological and sexual wellness, and that the majority of women do not choose to surgically alter their healthy vulva."

Enough women must feel that $10,000 is a small price to pay for the prospect of an improved sex life, or the possibility of "literally squeezing a ring" out of their boyfriend, for cosmetic vaginoplasty to have become a trend. But where medical practitioners are concerned, they've pointed out a lot of opportunity for them to do more harm than good.

## Pointless Shame: The English-Speaking World's Issue With Women's Breasts

As a parent I'll warn my kids about the permanence of the Web, its perils and how to avoid them. I'll particularly want any child of mine to understand the potential consequences of naked images of their bodies winding up online. It's prudent to teach kids how to navigate prevailing social norms, whatever they may be. But don't stories like this one demand something more from us than cautioning? When a child is bullied to the point of suicide partly because a photo of her breasts was circulated to her friends and family, shouldn't we ask ourselves why the Anglosphere retains social norms wherein being seen topless is regarded as horrifying and shameful?

Bullying is as troublesome culprit in this case as whatever pretext prompted it. The stigma against female nudity is nevertheless something that costs women the world over very dearly. And it benefits none of the places where it prevails. Think of earth as a great natural experiment, where certain parts of Scandinavia think nothing of co-ed naked saunas, and certain parts of the Middle East require women to cover themselves in head-to-toe burkas on the street. How many Americans, Canadians, or Brits believe societies that enforce female modesty are better off? Or that countries where immodesty is most stigmatized are more moral or functional?

Given prevailing social norms, perhaps this was a nightmare for Duchess Middleton. If so, that would be an understandable reaction. But what does it say about our culture that it's plausibly a "nightmare" for a physically attractive 30-year-old woman to be seen topless at a private home with her husband? I wouldn't dream of criticizing any Duchess Middleton reaction to this. In a similar position I might well be very upset at the invasion of privacy. What I couldn't help but imagine is how awesome it would've been had Middleton called a press conference on a nude beach, arrived topless with a thousand women, and told the assembled press, "The photographer who invaded my privacy had no right to capture those images, but I face that nightmare on a daily basis. And no one gives a damn until one of them photographs me topless? Grow up. I am unashamed of my body. In fact, I rather love it, as all these woman love their bodies. That makes some immature people uncomfortable. And it is their problem, not mine. If you're sitting at home obsessing over photos of me topless, or giggling and pointing on the streets, it's you who should feel embarrassment and shame, not me. I refuse to do it anymore."

Ours is a society where that People cover makes sense, and that speech would never happen. We're doing it wrong.

Note the subjects that are not being discussed here: sexual intercourse, hookups, abortion, religiosity, secularism, moral relativism. The impulse for many social and cultural conservatives will be to reject what I've written. I am interested in having that conversation and teasing out our assumptions. To preemptively clarify what I'm saying, permit me to remind you about Janet Jackson:

4. It is appropriate to castigate the photographer who captured images of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, sunbathing topless. For lucre, he needlessly humiliated someone, knowing the pain that it would cause. But there's more to the story. The coverage of the episode is perfectly summed up by the covermagazine chose:Given prevailing social norms, perhaps this was a nightmare for Duchess Middleton. If so, that would be an understandable reaction. But what does it say about our culture that it's plausibly a "nightmare" for a physically attractive 30-year-old woman to be seen topless at a private home with her husband? I wouldn't dream of criticizing any Duchess Middleton reaction to this. In a similar position I might well be very upset at the invasion of privacy. What I couldn't help but imagine is how awesome it would've been had Middleton called a press conference on a nude beach, arrived topless with a thousand women, and told the assembled press, "The photographer who invaded my privacy had no right to capture those images, but I facenightmare on a daily basis. And no one gives a damn until one of them photographs me topless? Grow up. I am unashamed of my body. In fact, I rather love it, as all these woman love their bodies. That makes some immature people uncomfortable. And it isproblem, not mine. If you're sitting at home obsessing over photos of me topless, or giggling and pointing on the streets, it'swho should feel embarrassment and shame, not me. I refuse to do it anymore."Ours is a society where thatcover makes sense, and that speech would never happen. We're doing it wrong. 3.

Yet we stigmatize the human body.

## Men Who Idealize Large Breasts Are More Likely Hostile Toward Women

A notion that physical preferences can be a manifestation of sexism

"It wasn't funny when her boss shook her boob as though he were shaking her hand, it was sexual harassment," reads a report of a California lawsuit yesterday. "[The plaintiff] claims he harassed her repeatedly with comments such as, 'God, your boobs look big today.'"

These things happen in 2013, despite mandatory corporate seminars and decades of lawsuits in the news, in a culture where people must by now know that what they're doing is wrong. These things happen between otherwise functional human men and women who stand upright and have mothers and can tie their own shoes. How?

Viren Swami and Martin Tovée at the Universities of Manchester and Newcastle, respectively, look into the intricate world of why physical ideals are ideals, and in turn why they drive people beyond reason and morality in the current Archives of Sexual Behavior.

The problem is primal, so the research methods are not to be outdone. 361 white British men were "taken to a quiet private location" to look at women. Not real women; 3D computer renderings. The men were allowed to rotate them 360 degrees. The only difference among the women was breast size.

The men were then asked to "make their ratings on a paper-and-pencil survey."

Men then decreed, with paper and pencil: The most-preferred breast size is "medium." That's the middle of the five images to the left.

But they also completed assessments of their attitudes about women -- on three interesting rubrics, which I recommend reading, as well:

Attitudes Toward Women Scale (sample prompt: ''Intoxication among women is worse than intoxication among men.'')

Hostility Towards Women Scale (sample prompt: ''I feel that many times women ﬂirt with men just to tease them or hurt them.")

Benevolent Sexism subscale of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (sample prompt: "Women, as compared to men, tend to have a more refined sense of culture and good taste.")

Swami and Tovée compared the results with the men's preferences in breast size, which showed that "men who more strongly endorsed benevolently sexist attitudes toward women, who more strongly objectiﬁed women, and who were more hostile toward women idealized a large female breast size."

It's the first study to make these associations. Which is interesting, though the explanations Swami and Tovée posit are complex and hypothetical; a slurry of power, sexuality, and gender identity. Media portrayals, hegemony, and cultural factors of heteronormativity unique to these British white men. All not to overlook evolutionary, inborn preferences for reproductively viable mates.

I suppose it's a step, though, toward understanding the underpinnings of physical preferences as they shape behavior; moving always and only away from "boss shook her boob as though he were shaking her hand" scenarios.

## The Reinvented Bra

"Does this... look right?" I asked, cupping one of 10 flexible, vaguely boob-shaped plastic bowls against one naked breast, while the other dangled there.

"Whichever one feels comfortable and covers you," the sales associate, Whitney, reassured me. "But yeah," she said, pointing under my arm, "you wanna get that in there."

"Right. Yikes." And I reached for a bigger bowl.

For my entire adult life, I've been a chronic in-public bra adjuster.

You've likely seen women like me before, restlessly digging around inside their shirts to fix what's gone wrong below deck, or jamming their thumbs in just below the armpits for a quick everything-back-in-place shakedown. The habitual tugger of underwires, the indiscreet scooper-and-tucker of stray underboob. My mother calls this habit "unbecoming."

An expert would probably call it evidence that I, like an oft-reported 8 out of 10 American women, wear a bra that doesn't fit. But as an annually fitted, routine buyer of D-cup bras, I've always called it the small karmic price I pay for being able to wear strapless dresses, or for having a surefire strategy to catch a lazy bartender's attention in a pinch.

When I saw a story in The New York Times recently, though -- "A New Step in Wrestling With the Bra" -- I couldn't help but feel a little wistful. Undergarment emperor Jockey, according to the story, was reinventing the bra with the goal of creating the ultimate comfortable garment that could perfectly fit and support a woman of any shape.

Jockey Jockey

After screening hundreds of women and listening to women's complaints about their bras -- about their uncomfortable or unsupportive fit; their inconsistent sizing; their jabby, constricting underwires; even their favorite manufacturers' habit of discontinuing their favorite styles -- Jockey spent eight years engineering a new product called, creatively, the Jockey Bra. Now available for purchase, the it looks identical to a conventional bra, but it aims (and claims) to be much more: According to Jockey, the "reinvented" bra solves these assorted problems by offering consistent sizing in styles that won't be discontinued, plus a flexible resin "3-D contour" piece instead of an underwire ("Because we're not flat," as Whitney explained). And perhaps most radically, the Jockey Bra has thrown out the traditional sizing system in favor of "volumetric sizing" -- that is, a larger variety of cup sizes and shapes designed to more securely accommodate a larger variety of breasts, which could keep women comfier and even potentially healthier.

And that's how I ended up naked in front of Whitney, clutching what looked like a warped Frisbee to my chest. The promise of a no-fuss, strap-it-on-and-forget-about-it bra beckoned.

Was it too good to be true?

Well, yes and no.

The ill-fitting bra problem, by Jockey's logic, results from a time-honored tradition of bra manufacturers failing to take into consideration the actual shape and weight of a breast.

Traditionally, bra cup sizes are based on two measurements: the distance around the breasts at their fullest point (the "nipple line," it's sometimes called) minus the circumference of the ribcage just below the breast tissue (or "under-bust"). A one-inch difference corresponds to an A-cup; two inches, a B-cup, et cetera.

But as Jockey's slogan goes, "You wouldn't measure a pitcher of water in inches." In other words, because a breast -- especially a larger breast -- is malleable and often somewhat round, measuring a garment to support it is a little more complicated than the alphanumeric system of bust-circumference-minus-chest-wall-circumference accounts for.

Hence the 10 different sizes of jellyfish-esque "volumetric fit cups" that were lined up in a row before me. As Whitney explained to me while I boob-tested one "fit cup" after another, each larger size is shaped more like a rounder, fuller breast to ensure that the closest possible measurement of actual breast tissue gets taken. (For more on how that works, watch Jessica, whose breasts are made of glass, get fitted in the Jockey promotional video)

The women who might benefit the most from the Jockey Bra, Whitney explained, are those women with what she calls "pendulous" breasts, or larger breasts that hang down onto the chest wall. If a woman has pendulous breasts (and many women do), the traditional nipple-line-minus-ribcage measurement doesn't account for any breast tissue that hangs below the nipple line. A bra, of course, lifts the breasts upward. A cup that's the purported "right" size for a woman with pendulous breasts, then, can leave some overspill on the sides or over the top of the cup, which can weigh down the front of the bra and cause it to ride up in the back or dig uncomfortably into the shoulders.

Other negative health effects of wearing an insufficiently supportive bra have been well-documented over the years. Breast pain and back pain are well-known side effects of poor bra fit, and very concerned osteopath Jon-Morton Bell even warned British news outlet The Independent:

If a woman is bending forward because of insufficient breast support, the trapezius overstretches and causes headaches. All nerve roots come from the back; stomach upsets and fatigue are common by-products of bad back health.

So a new method for finding precisely the right cup size and shape could be immensely helpful for women -- especially those women with pendulous breasts -- who find their postures affected by bras that don't adequately support them.

"Pendulous," I repeated. "Is that what I have?"

Whitney laughed politely. Not as pendulous as some she'd seen.

The Jockey Bra comes in 55 sizes -- based on combinations of 10 different cup sizes and seven under-bust measurements -- and five different styles. In the spirit of finding the garment that truly best conformed to and supported my natural shape, I chose, quite literally, the bra of least resistance: the un-padded, full-coverage Double Lined Contour model in the weirdly foreign size "7-34." Then my brand-new, "closest thing to custom" Jockey Bra was placed in my hands in what looked like a light-blue shoebox, like a glass boob-slipper that promised to transform me from a maternally embarrassing underwire yanker to an effortlessly well-supported princess.

The next day at work, I was dismayed to find that I was not any more of a princess than I had been the day before. I felt, as per usual, like a person wearing a bra.

But I did find that I had less fidgety hands.

In the Jockey Bra, the following everyday activities could be completed without the obligatory re-shuffle afterward:

Running to catch a waiting elevator before the doors closed.

Bending over to get a yogurt from the bottom shelf of the office fridge.

A midday finally-outta-the-desk-chair overhead stretch.

Scampering down an escalator in time to hop aboard a subway train.

Resuming normal upright evening activities after an accidental couch nap.

Ashtanga yoga in a zero-gravity chamber.*

Jumping rope on a trampoline while driving 60 miles per hour over speed bumps.*

*Not actually tested

Now, make no mistake: The Jockey Bra I chose, though fabulously un-frustrating, was also terrifically, terrifyingly unsexy. Perhaps that's because I picked a model with a "natural" fit, which does the opposite of what a pushup bra might do. (Rather than lifting and smushing together, it just sort of... cradles, like a couple of hammocks.) Or perhaps that's simply because it's a bra made by Jockey -- and bras made by Jockey aren't generally the kind you wear under an anniversary dinner-date ensemble anyway.

But for pattering around my office on a Thursday, comfortably un-voluptuous was a perfectly acceptable option -- and the hands-free, low-maintenance nature of a bra that fit snugly and firmly was a productivity-boosting surprise.

Jockey's radical "reinvention" of the bra didn't reinvent my life, but a better-fitting bra certainly made me a less squirmy human -- and more shape-conscious sizing systems could make an even bigger difference for women whose musculoskeletal health is adversely affected by an ill-fitting bra. If Jockey's new undergarment sizing system signals the future of the bra, we could look forward to less aggressive underwires, fewer over-burdened shoulder straps, and a generally less fidgety tomorrow.

## Porn on the Kindle: A Catch-22

"Many of us realized immediately that, like the Internet, the Kindle was made for porn." So wrote the pseudonymous kinukitty at my website, The Hooded Utilitarian, a while back -- and the use of the pseudonym underlines the insight. Consuming porn is something people often prefer to do at least semi-anonymously -- especially people who happen to be women. By dispensing with book covers, and indeed with books, the Kindle has made it possible for readers to peruse 50 Shades of Grey wheresoer they go, without fear of scorn -- and, for that matter, without fear of harassment. According to the (also pseudonymous) porn writer Venus Santiago, back in the 90s, when she purchased Black Lace titles at a brick and mortar store, "the clerk felt free to hit on me." After that happened several times, Santiago said, she stopped buying in public.

With the Kindle, though, you don't need to buy in public. As Santiago wrote me by email:

The beautiful thing about buying porn on Kindle is that nobody sneers at you. It's just you, Amazon, and your personal mobile device. You can read it on the train or subway, at home, wherever, and no one has any idea what you're ogling. Which removes most of the outside negative social pressure that prevents a lot of women who are interested in porn from buying it in the mainstream places (sex shops, online XXX websites).

As a result, pornographic e-books have taken off. 50 Shades is the successful mainstream phenomenon that everyone knows about, but there are tons more where that came from, and tons kinkier as well. E.L. James' nervous flirtations with BDSM are perhaps titillating by the standards of the rest of the best-seller list. But her too-timid-to-even-sign-the-contract relationship shenanigans barely even register as kink compared to the other offerings available via e-book, where step-sibling incest, minotaur porn, and futanari abound. Santiago for her part has written gay assassin romance as well as a series of cheerfully perverse stories featuring human cow lactation porn, in which submission, degradation, and impossible busts exist alongside a remarkably detailed grasp of dairy industry mechanics.

The Kindle, then, provides both privacy and the promise that somewhere, someone has written exactly the gay werewolf paranormal romance you've always wanted to read. Combine the privacy and range of titles, and there's little doubt that for readers digital is the perfect porn delivery system.

Which seems to have made Amazon somewhat uncomfortable. Back in 2010, Amazon deleted many erotica e-books with incest themes -- not only dropping them from its store, but actually electronically erasing old titles from consumers' digital devices. (It later claimed the erasures were a mistake, though its policy on incest titles remains unclear.) More recently, the company has been filtering some erotic titles, so that they don't appear in the All Departments search. To find them, you need to search directly in Books or in the Kindle store. For example, Santiago's title Accidental Milkmaid 3: Gangbanged by Bulls shows up in the Kindle Store, but not in the All Departments search. On the other hand, high-profile erotica like 50 Shades, or, for that matter, Lady Chatterley's Lover, appears in both kinds of searches.

Fiddling with the search function may seem like a relatively benign step. In practice, though, it has an impact on sales, and can render a title essentially invisible. Selena Kitt, the pen name of a successful erotica author who makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a month by writing porn e-books, has referred to Amazon's filtering as the Pornocalypse. Previous Amazon rejiggerings of their search function have at various points cut her monthly income by a third, she says.

In an essay on her website, Kitt argues that that Amazon's seeming efforts to hide the porn are both hypocritical and a bad case of biting-the-hand.

Erotica, as a genre, has been Amazon's dirty little secret from the beginning, driving sales of the Kindle to astronomical numbers. Does Amazon really believe that it was all the free copies of "Huckleberry Finn" and "Moby Dick" ... that drove readers to buy Kindle devices? Nope, sorry. It was erotica. It was "porn."

Kitt is angry, and you can understand why. She works hard, is successful, and instead of giving her accolades, her business partners keep her product hidden from would-be readers.

I was not able to get a comment for Amazon for this piece, so I don't know for sure why they are manipulating search functions. Nor do I know why they refuse to explain their standards to authors. One of Kitt's chief frustrations is that Amazon won't tell her what she needs to do to keep her book from being filtered, and that they seem to keep changing the rules on her.

Amazon's policies may be unnecessarily opaque, but reading Kitt's essay, you can at least see a possible motivation for the company's apparent Puritanism. Kitt herself, like Santiago and kinukitty, believes that the appeal of porn on the Kindle is precisely that it allows for reading of content surreptitiously. Porn may have helped make the Kindle successful, but a big part of the reason that the Kindle is so perfectly made for porn is that it doesn't look like it's made for porn. Women (and men, too) who want to read porn on the Kindle don't want to be buying their porn from some place that screams porn! Amazon's advantage as a seller of porn is precisely that it sells lots of things that aren't porn, and that it is known primarily for selling things that aren't porn.

Porn e-book writers and readers, then, are in a catch-22. Folks like Amazon porn because Amazon isn't branded as a porn outlet. But as long as Amazon isn't branded as a porn outlet, the company is going to see X-rated content as something of an embarrassment. The same incentives that drive writers to use pseudonyms and readers to use the Kindle also drive retailers to keep porn from showing up in searches and make them want to keep it off best-seller lists. For many good reasons, and perhaps some bad ones, nobody -- not readers, not writers, not retailers -- wants to publically embrace the porn.

## Donating Orgasms to Science

As I drive the five miles from my house in suburban New Jersey to Rutgers University Brain Imaging Center, I take a mental inventory of my data. So far, I have collected 13 self-stimulation orgasms but only 6 orgasms brought about through partner stimulation. The goal is to have an equal number of both.

I feel the familiar wash of anxiety about to launch me into the low-level panic typical of a graduate student in her dissertation year. Except I am no typical graduate student—I am a 56-year-old sex therapist turned cognitive neuroscientist whose day job is to study the human sexual response, and my dissertation is on genital stimulation and female orgasm.

Pulling into the parking lot, I brace for the day. There is much to do to prepare for the study scheduled for 1 p.m. The participant and her partner will arrive at 9:30 a.m. They will need to complete a stack of paperwork—consent forms, MRI safety checklists, and an additional form that verifies that the female participant is not pregnant—and then will have to be carefully trained in the protocol for the study.

I wear a number of hats in the lab. As a therapist with three decades of clinical experience, I am foremost a people-person. My job requires that I make our participants comfortable and keep them safe as they go about the unusual business of donating orgasms to science. My other role—as the principal investigator of my dissertation study—means that I am responsible for making sure that the technical aspects of the study are properly executed and all the details necessary for a smooth study come together simultaneously. And then I must be the one to analyze the data afterwards, a laborious, pain-staking process that has taken years to learn.

No matter how comfortable participants may be with their sexuality in the real world, donating an orgasm to science in a sterile scanner is awkward at best.

I arrive at our campus office—a cinder-block, fluorescent-lit room that also serves as home to the psychology department’s part-time lecturers who are often entertained by the circus that sometimes is our lab—and promptly dump a bag full of linens onto an empty desk. We will need them later. When I first started this tour of duty in grad school, we did our studies at the medical school, which provided hospital linens. Now I am the laundry lady as well as the project chief. I have heard through the grapevine that some of the other users of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner facility were perturbed at the prospect of the scanner table being contaminated by bodily fluids, so I am vigilant about maintaining the pristine condition of the equipment.

I glance at the checklist tacked on the bulletin board. All it takes is one careless misstep and the consequences could range from catastrophic—for example, if we neglect the proper fMRI safety practices and some metal propelled by the powerful magnet hurtles into the bore of the scanner and impales a participant—to stupid—if a minor glitch in a computer program renders the expensive scan and subsequent data useless. Setting up my laptop to run the practice experiment for the participants to review once they arrive, I savor the stillness before the chaos begins.

I know my participants will be anxious when they arrive. No matter how comfortable they may be with their sexuality in the real world, donating an orgasm to science in the context of the sterile environment of the scanner is awkward at best. I should know. In the tradition of many scientists who have experimented on themselves, I have been the guinea pig for my own studies. I often share the experience with participants to make them feel more comfortable.

Armed with a Xanax tucked into my bra just in case, I am about to go into the MRI scanner for the first time—a daunting task for a claustrophobic, panic-prone individual under any circumstances. And the task at hand involves inserting a plastic dildo into my vagina while my colleagues sit in the control room next door. Having recently joined the team as a sex therapist and collaborator, thanks to the brilliant Dr. Beverly Whipple—an eminent sex scientist who is known for many things, including the naming of the G-spot—I am piloting a prospective study in which we will systematically map the projections of the clitoris, anterior wall of the vagina, cervix, and nipple onto the somatosensory cortex. Suffice it to say if you enjoy the sensation of touch, you are already a fan of the somatosensory cortex. It is the area of the brain that processes the input from parts of the body that are sensitive to touch, temperature, and pain. The valuable real estate of the somatosensory cortex is arranged proportionally to reflect how much sensory acuity a given body region has. The somatosensory cortex is sometimes represented by a figure called the sensory homunculus or “little man” —looking like a cartoonish Mick Jagger—all lips, fingers, and penis. The figure resizes body parts based on how sensitive they are to touch.

Since the neurosurgeon Wilfred Penfield originally mapped the somatosensory cortex in the 1950’s, not much has been done about fine-tuning the representation of genitals in the somatosensory cortex. And even less is know about what some of have called the hermunculus, or “little woman,” in the brain. This information has clinical implications in the treatment of pelvic pain disorders, sexual dysfunctions such as the inability to orgasm, (anorgasmia), painful intercourse (dysparuenia,) low sexual desire (hypoactive sexual desire disorder), and other disorders affecting both men and women. The astounding gaps in the scientific literature about all things sexual are what motivate me to get up in the morning.

By a process of elimination, I am the only suitable guinea pig. My advisor, Dr. Barry Komisaruk, lacks the requisite genitalia—and the other team members are too young and green for the task. A good researcher pilots her own study. We wouldn’t want to subject our participants to this investigation until we work out the kinks, so to speak.

So the plastic purple dildo and I are in the scanner, trying to make friends, and things get out of hand. The dildo is slippery and since my head and the upper half of my body is encased in the bore of the scanner, I can’t see what I am doing. The dildo sails across the small room that houses the big magnet, only to land somewhere. The scan runs another five minutes during which I am supposed to be rhythmically stimulating the anterior wall of my vagina. I entertain myself by contemplating how I am going to inform my colleagues of the situation. When the banging of the coils subsides, indicating that the run has timed out, the MRI tech, Gregg, asks through the wired-in microphone, “How’s it going, Nan?”

“Houston, we have a problem,” I respond. “The dildo went into orbit.” I laugh so hard I can hardly speak. The unflappable tech comes in to search for the missing phallic projectile. They leave me alone in the scanner while he goes to disinfect the dildo outside. Jim, a tall nuclear medicine tech walks by while Gregg is washing the dildo in the sink by the nurses’ station. “What in the world are you doing?’ Jim asks.

“I’m working," Gregg replies. Jim shakes his head and walks away.

If I ever write a memoir, it will be called "A Watched Orgasm Rarely Boils."

For many months, the flying purple dildo story was a favorite topic at the grad student happy hours, which I learned later when I enrolled in the Ph.D. program and joined the ranks.

Six years have passed since my maiden voyage in the magnet. Since then, I have logged enough hours in the scanner to qualify for frequent flyer points. In the scanner, I have had orgasms through clitoral self-stimulation, orgasms through vaginal stimulation, cervical stimulation, and even orgasms through thought alone. I could think myself to orgasm without any physical stimulation even before I started studying sex. I attribute that ability to many years of intense yoga study.

But the only yoga I do these days amounts to a few forward bends in the shower. I am a woman obsessed with my work. There is nothing that can kill the buzz like thinking too much about what is happening in your brain while you are having sex. If I ever write a memoir, it will be called A Watched Orgasm Rarely Boils.

Now, six years later, the participants have completed the paperwork and been painstakingly prepared for the study protocol. The first part of the experiment alternates between imagined stimulation and actual stimulation, to see how the brain represents them differently. Then after the imagery segment of the study, the participants are asked to have two orgasms in the scanner, one through self-stimulation of their clitoris; the other through clitoral stimulation provided by their partner.

After we brief the subjects on the protocol, it is time to make what we call the Hannibal Lechter Happy Helmet, a scary looking contraption we have designed to stabilize the participant’s head during the scan. It is exceedingly hard to keep ones’ head still during genital stimulation, and even more so during the involuntary movements of orgasm. If, during the course of the scan, the participant’s head moves more than 2 mm, (corresponding to the thickness of two dimes), the data becomes noisy and unreliable. “Head movement is the enemy,” I say, as I put the participant into position on the table of the scanner. And then the study begins.

## Living Myths About Virginity

Laci Green grabs a thin sheet of latex, stretches it over the end of an empty toilet paper tube, and starts cutting away with a pair of scissors. "I'm makin' a hymennn," she sings before holding up the finished product to the camera, where, on the other side, more than 700,000 subscribers now await her every upload. "Ta-da!"

Since 2008, the 24-year-old YouTube sex educator has been making informational videos about everything from slut shaming and body image to genital hygiene and finding the G-spot. This particular scene comes from a clip called "You Can't POP Your Cherry (HYMEN 101)" which explains, with the kind of bubbly, web-savvy humor that makes her a popular vlogger, that the hymen isn't a membrane that needs to bleed or be broken during intercourse—it's actually just small, usually elastic folds of mucous tissue that only partially cover the vaginal opening and can, but don’t always, tear if stretched. A year and a half after it premiered, with well more than one million views, Green's video debunking one of the most enduring misconceptions about virginity is also one of the most popular segment she's ever recorded.

For a lot of women (and men), Green's message is hardly news, for any number of reasons. Several comments on the video, which still arrive almost daily, point that out. But other comments tell a different story: that myths about virginity, sex, and basic biology still pervade even among sexually active adults, and when those myths get reinforced by vacuums of reliable information and sexist messages ingrained in popular culture, they can have serious consequences for women's health.

“Every night I have people come up to me about this video in particular,” Green, who takes her sex-positive presentations to college campuses across the country, tells me. “‘I’m so glad I saw this.’ ‘Sex was so much better than I thought it was.’ ‘It didn’t hurt.’ It’s sad to me that people expect this to be a painful experience.”

When Therese Shechter lost her virginity at age 23, it wasn’t the firework-spouting, momentous occasion she had come to expect. On the contrary, it was kind of unremarkable given the hype. Now a filmmaker, Shechter spent much of the past six years working on her new documentary How to Lose Your Virginity, which revisits her experience—including the basement apartment where it happened, now, funnily enough, a flower shop called Bloom—and explores the "myths and misogyny" behind one of society's most institutionalized rites of passage.

Fewer than half of all women bleed during the first time they have sex. Experiences vary from individual to individual and depend on factors like lubrication and arousal.

Through interviews with historians, abstinence advocates, sex educators, and self-described virgins and non-virgins alike, Shechter learned she's not the only one who had certain ideas about what sex is supposed to be like. There are a number of pervasive and loaded myths about virginity: That having sex for the first time will be an irreversible transformation that changes your body and mind; that there’s a “right” way to lose your virginity, and how you lose it will affect the rest of your life; that it's going to be the most pleasurable, magical feeling; that it's going to be the most painful experience of their lives. These myths persist in part because of a lack of information about what happens to the human body, specifically the hymen, during sex—information that's often not taught in schools, that's not always found online, and that's not always available from medical providers.

“I’ve spoken to lots of women who are just terrified of having sex because they think it’s going to be this horrible pain and [they’ll] bleed gallons of blood,” says Shechter, whose documentary makes its broadcast premiere on February 8 on the Fusion Network and is airing in cities across the U.S. and internationally in coming months.

Abstinence-only education in U.S. schools isn't to blame for creating these myths, but Shechter and Green say the programs, which have received more than $1.5 billion dollars and counting in federal funding since 1996 despite mounting research about their ineffectiveness, do create environments where this kind of misinformation thrives. (Even some schools with more comprehensive programs, Green notes, are guilty of getting the facts wrong, too.) Abstinence-only education promotes marriage as the proper venue for sexual activity and the only prevention method for STDs and pregnancy—it doesn't offer information about how, once someone becomes sexually active, to make sure sex isn't painful or how to avoid the kind of bleeding Green talks about. (Fewer than half of all women bleed during the first time they have sex; they can bleed a little or a lot, or not at all, and it can be painful or painless. There’s a range of experiences that vary from individual to individual and depend on factors like use of lubrication and levels of arousal.)

Reliable information is out there, but it doesn't always find its way to young women (or men) who could benefit from it. Kiki Zeldes, a senior editor of Our Bodies, Ourselves, the landmark book about women’s health and sexuality published by a Boston-based non-profit, says the Internet can often lead astray young women looking for answers. While sites like Scarleteen, an independent sex-education website founded in 1998, are devoted to providing accurate, non-judgmental information to young people, Zeldes says she's concerned by the number of Google search results and general information sites that describe the hymen as a tissue that completely covers the vaginal opening, one that tears and bleeds. "There are a tremendous number of women who don't understand how their bodies work and what happens when they are sexually active," says Zeldes, who adds that “hymen” is the most-searched term on the book’s website. "There's lots of information out there, but it's more about reaching young women in formats that they will hear."

"Your average gynecologist doesn't know a whole lot about the hymen."

Even the medical community contributes to that void. Most medical schools offer little education about the hymen, according to Virgin: The Untouched History author and historian Hanne Blank, and for relevant reasons: it's medically uninteresting and very rarely poses health problems—it's just tissue left over from sometime between the fifth and seventh months of fetal development, roughly. "Your average gynecologist doesn't know a whole lot [about the hymen]," Blank says. "From the medical perspective, we could fairly charitably say there's a wide range of knowledge, and there's a wide range of belief. Doctors are the same as everyone else. Unless an individual physician has taken efforts to educate themselves, chances are what they think they know about the hymen is more reflective of what's around them."

One Swedish sexual health organization felt that misinformation about the hymen was so rampant that it decided to do away with the word entirely. In 2009, the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) began promoting the term "vaginal corona" as an alternative in order to dispel myths and rebuild associations with this part of the body from scratch. (None of the women I spoke to expect the term to catch on in any serious way—though the latest edition of Our Bodies, Ourselves does adapt RFSU's materials—but all agreed it was an important symbolic step in rebooting the conversation.)

Myths about virginity don't exist solely because of misinformation about the hymen, however, and that's because the concept of virginity existed long before the hymen was even identified. First acknowledged in the 16th century by anatomist Andreas Vesalius, the hymen, historically speaking, is a relatively new discovery; social and cultural ideas about virginity, on the other hand, have been building on thousands and thousands of years of history. For reference: Flip open a Bible to the Book of Deuteronomy, which declares that if "tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel … [then] the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die."

What constitutes "purity," it turns out, is surprisingly messy.

The exact origins of virginity are difficult to pinpoint, Blank says, because people have been talking about virginity for as long as we’ve had written records, and the earliest mentions of virginity suggest it was already an established concept. (One popular explanation, called the K-Strategist Theory, suggests men used virginity to help determine paternity—a way to make sure the material resources they devoted to new or expectant mothers weren’t wasteful investments.) Despite its long history, virginity has never had a precise definition. Many associate the word with penile-vaginal intercourse between cisgender men and women, but that's not the only way two people can be sexually active together, and that definition also excludes LGBTQ people. What constitutes the idea of purity, it turns out, is surprisingly messy.

Yet what's allowed virginity to persist in spite of this, Blank says, is that virginity is a highly effective way of organizing women. Throughout history, virginity tests, like the "string test" (which "determined" virginity based on the relative size of your head and neck) Blank performs on Shechter in How to Lose Your Virginity, weren’t really concerned with science so much as they were concerned with control: However nebulous its definition, virginity easily sorts women into those who have had sex and those who haven't, which, in societies that place value on a women's purity, also helps determine their worth.

That value system—and the idea that a woman's first sexual experience is this permanent, hymen-breaking change—is reinforced by the language used to talk about a woman's first time,: She lost her virginity; he took her virginity; She gave it up to him; he popped her cherry; she was deflowered. "It's kind of violent," Green says in her video as she comically jabs a dildo into her home-made model of a hymen. These words, she argues, don't just further the idea that there's a painful or bloody transformation, they also carry a lot of baggage about gender roles. They characterize women as passive with something to lose, and men as the aggressors with something to gain; they suggest that men are the stewards of virginity—the same idea behind the “purity balls” that take place across the country today, where young girls pledge their virginity to their fathers until husbands come along.

For evidence of just how strongly these ideas about virginity and sex are rooted in popular culture, Shechter points to the number of businesses that profit off them. Genres of pornography fetishize virginity and frequently depict the moment innocent school girls are "corrupted.” Hymenoplasties, or controversial surgeries that "reconstruct" the hymen to induce bleeding during sex as proof of virginity, have become an established practice around the world (stories about the trend have appeared in Time magazine and The New York Times, which, it’s worth noting, called the hymen "the vaginal membrane that normally breaks in the first act of intercourse" in its reporting). In her film, Shechter meets with a wedding dress vendor who markets a dress's virginal qualities as a selling point.

Male partners' expectations of blood in particular sometimes leads women to take drastic, unhealthy measures.

"You click back to that other time for the [wedding] day because now you're this dirty, ruined women," Shechter says. "We still make jokes, 'I can't wear white at my wedding.' All that [says] is there's this object of value, and when it's given away or taken or sold, that value is lost. [Virginity] sells purity rings and artificial hymens [because] being perceived as not having that value can be a death sentence." Women do still get killed over others' perceptions of their own virginity: In 2005, an Alabama woman told a Birmingham police detective she killed her 12-year-old daughter by pouring bleach down her throat because her daughter revealed she was no longer a virgin.

Male partners' expectations of blood in particular sometimes leads women to take drastic, unhealthy measures: In How to Lose Your Virginity, Shechter reports on women who sewed stitches into their vaginas to make sure they bled. Artificial hymens that can be inserted into the vagina and "bleed" red dyes can be bought online cheaply and have been trendy in China, but have also been known to cause infections. Green says she's even heard from women who said their boyfriends became verbally abusive when there wasn’t any blood or pain following their first time having sex. “People told me they show their boyfriends my video and explain why there wasn’t any bleeding," Green says. "It’s kind of bizarre when you have these kids getting angry at each other because there wasn’t enough blood.”

Because hymens vary greatly from person to person, they’re not reliable indicators of virginity—How to Lose Your Virginity even features a film clip from the 1940s saying as much—but the myth that looking at a hymen can reveal whether a woman has had sex can still discourage women from seeking medical care. "The biggest question we're asked is, 'Can a doctor or a boyfriend tell if I've had sex before?' Zeldes says. "Many people think they can, so they're scared to go to a gynecologist or a GYN exam because they're scared, one, that it could make them not a virgin, and, two, someone would be able to tell."

But what Blank and Zeldes say is one of the most widespread consequences—and the one Green says convinced her to make her video in the first place—is simply fear. Myths about virginity cast a shadow of negativity over young people’s attitudes toward sex. They keep can people from taking ownership of their sexualities and bodies through informed decision-making. They can turn what could be a pleasurable and fun experience into an event that’s scary, stressful, and needlessly traumatic.

"I'm not of the belief that for teenagers having sex, it should be terrible," Green says. "You remember your first time as a time when you were terrified, and I think that's really sad."

## Why Most Brazilian Women Get C-Sections

In many parts of the world, women are having more Cesarean sections than medically necessary. Recent abuses of pregnant women in Brazil have sparked a small, vocal movement of activists who want mothers to have more say in the delivery room.

RECIFE, Brazil — When Ivana Borges learned she was pregnant, she told her obstetrician that she wanted a natural birth. Her mother had delivered five children without surgery or medication, and Borges wanted to follow her example.

But when she returned to the hospital after her water broke, the same doctor began persuading her that she should instead deliver by caesarean section.

“He told me I wasn’t getting dilated enough,” Borges told me. “I said, ‘I can wait!’ Then he started joking that I couldn’t handle the pain.”

He pestered her while she labored for six hours, and gradually Borges, who was 24 years old at the time, began feeling powerless and overwhelmed. She caved. The C-section commenced, but that wasn’t the end of the doctor’s heckling.

“He was saying, ‘I was at a birthday party, and I want this done fast because I want to go back and finish my whiskey,’” she said.

Borges said the experience was so traumatic that she sought psychiatric help for depression after the birth.

‘When you were doing it, you didn't complain, but now that you're here, you cry.’

Doctors and activists here say Borges's experience is fairly common among women who give birth in the country’s private hospitals, where 82 percent of all babies are born by C-section. Brazil has a free, public healthcare system, but many of its wealthier residents—about a quarter of the population—use a private insurance scheme that functions much like the U.S. medical system.

With the higher price of the private system comes better amenities and shorter wait times, but also all of the trappings of fee-for-service medical care. C-sections can be easily scheduled and quickly executed, so doctors schedule and bill as many as eight procedures a day rather than wait around for one or two natural births to wrap up.

“It’s a money machine,” Borges said.

The economics of private insurance certainly play a role, but culture is also a big part of what drives the C-section epidemic here.

“Childbirth is something that is primitive, ugly, nasty, inconvenient,” Simone Diniz, associate professor in the department of maternal and child health at the University of São Paulo, said. “It takes long, and the idea is we have to make it fast. It’s impolite for doctors to leave cases for the doctors on the next shift. There’s a sense that you need to either accelerate it or do a C-section.”

Even in public hospitals, the C-section rate is roughly half of all births. Because so many patients are booked in advance for C-section procedures, women who want natural births find themselves on zero-hour sojourns to find free beds. One Sao Paulo doctor told me that some physicians ask for bribes in exchange for allowing mothers to deliver naturally. And in an extreme example from earlier this month, a woman named Adelir Carmen Lemos de Goés was forced by police to deliver by C-section in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.

As a 2005 editorial in the Brazilian Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology put it, "There is no doubt that, even if it contains unnecessary or even greater risk to the mother or the newborn, ceasarean section has a much lower risk for the obstetrician.”

Granted, many women ask for the procedure of their own accord, seeing the convenience and sterility of it all as a marker of liberation rather than oppression. Rio and Sao Paulo are dotted with upscale C-section resort clinics where women get post-op manicures and room service.

But a 2001 study of Brazilian women published in the British Medical Journal concluded that the country’s rise in C-sections was driven primarily by unwanted procedures rather than personal preference. And some women elect to go under the knife only after hearing about the rough treatment of mothers who choose the alternative.

"Here, when a woman is going to give birth, even natural birth, the first thing many hospitals do is tie her to the bed by putting an IV in her arm, so she can't walk, can't take a bath, can't hug her husband. The use of drugs to accelerate contractions is very common, as are episiotomies," Maria do Carmo Leal, a researcher at the National Public Health School at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, told the AP. "What you get is a lot of pain, and a horror of childbirth. This makes a cesarean a dream for many women."

Many physicians’ attitudes toward childbirth weave together Brazil’s macho culture with traditional sexual mores.

“There’s the idea that the experience of childbirth should be humiliating,” Diniz said. “When women are in labor, some doctors say, ‘When you were doing it, you didn't complain, but now that you're here, you cry.’”

This brashness manifests itself in other types of interventions during labor. Though Brazilian law mandates that all women be allowed doulas or birthing companions, few moms are actually accompanied by such helpers. In past years, some Brazilian cities tried to bar birthing companions from hospitals entirely.

Diniz said many doctors unnecessarily overuse fundal pressure—pushing on the pregnant woman’s stomach—to speed things along, and that they administer the labor hormone oxytocin more frequently than needed. The vast majority of women who give birth vaginally also have episiotomies, or surgical cuts to the vagina that are intended to make delivery easier.

“We have a really serious problem in Brazil that the doctors over-cite evidence [of fetal distress],” said Paula Viana, head of a women’s rights nonprofit in Recife. “They think they can interfere as they would like."

There’s nothing wrong with C-sections, of course. They can be life-saving for women with distressed babies or difficult deliveries. And most of the activists who are concerned about rising C-section rates think women should be able to opt for the procedure if they really want one.

But it’s still a major abdominal surgery that brings with it a chance of complications, infection, and neonatal challenges, not to mention placental problems that might impact future births. Women who have C-sections that are not medically necessary are at a greater risk of death, blood transfusions, and hysterectomies, a 2010 World Health Organization study found. The WHO has, until recently, recommended that C-sections be limited to 15 percent of all births.

“Brazil has highlighted this issue, but it's shouting a secret."

But the rate in many other countries, including Brazil, is much higher. In China, nearly half of all babies are delivered this way, with some women finding it a simple way to choose a “lucky” birthday. In the U.S., the rate has reached 30 percent after rising for decades. Experts say that among American doctors, fear of litigation is what prompts them to reach for the scalpel.

The increase is “really based on protecting the institution and ourselves,” obstetrician Peter Doelger told WNPR. “And, you can’t blame them. Getting sued is a horrible thing for the physician, a horrible thing for the nurse, and a horrible thing for the institution."

Jesusa Ricoy-Olariaga, a Spanish childbirth educator, helped organize a series of rallies in multiple countries on Friday that called for the improved treatment of women in labor worldwide. The protesters used the social media hashtag #SomosTodasAdelir—we are all Adelir.

“Brazil has highlighted this issue, but it's shouting a secret,” Ricoy-Olariaga told me by phone. “The issue is the same in other countries, but in a different manner. There are countries where birth is industrialized and dominated by men, and there's very little input from women.”

For its part, Brazil is working to reverse course and promote natural births. The federal government is spending $4 billion on a program—dubbed “the Stork Network”—that plans to educate both mothers and doctors about the benefits of giving birth the old-fashioned way.

But women at the small #SomosTodasAdelir rally in Recife on Friday said it will take a major cultural shift, as well. Mariana Bahia told me that when she miscarried a few months ago, her obstetrician treated her brusquely because she suspected Bahia had attempted to abort her fetus, which is illegal here.

Bahia said she wants to see women wield greater autonomy in the maternity ward —and to see doctors’ bullying behavior punished.

“There’s no horizontality between patients and doctors,” Bahia said. “Doctors are always above us.”

## Why No One Can Design a Better Speculum

Few women enjoy pelvic exams: the crinkly paper dress, the awkward questions, the stirrups, the vague fear that can comes with doctors’s visits of any kind (what if they find something abnormal, something bad, something cancerous?). But perhaps no piece of the pelvic exam is as reviled as the vaginal speculum—the cold, clicking, duck-billed apparatus that lifts and separates the vaginal walls so a near-stranger can peer inside.

The speculum’s history is, like many medical histories, full of dubious ethics. Versions of the speculum have been found in medical texts dating back to the Greek physician Galen in 130 A.D. and shown up in archaeological digs as far back as 79 A.D. amidst the dust of Pompeii. (The artifact from Pompeii is a bit of a nightmare: two blades that open and close via a corkscrew-like mechanism.)

But the speculum most women experience today is largely credited to a man named James Marion Sims, often heralded as the father of American gynecology. He was a controversial figure even in his day, and should probably remain one now.

Sims’s early gynecological experiments were done on slave women who, in many cases, he purchased and kept as property in the back of his private hospital. Along with this violent legacy, Sims left behind a few medical advances and inventions—one of them being the vaginal speculum. While the design has been refined, the speculum women see today isn’t all that different from the one Sims used on his captive patients.

One might expect our modern spirit of innovation and disruption to turn its eye on the speculum. Surely something invented so long ago, under such dubious circumstances, could use an update. And many have tried. In the past 10 years, new designs for the speculum have continuously cropped up, only to fade away again. But while medical manufacturers continue to improve the design in little ways, there has been no real contender to displace the duck-billed model. The speculum’s history is inextricably linked to extreme racism and misogyny. But for all that, it just may be the best design we’re ever likely to have.

In 1845, Sims opened up a private hospital for women in Montgomery, Alabama. Slave owners in the surrounding areas brought their ailing women to him, and one of the more common problems he saw was something called vesicovaginal fistulas—a condition often caused by prolonged childbirth, in which a hole forms in between the bladder or rectum and the vagina. The tear causes urine and feces to pool in the vagina, creating infections, pain, and incontinence. Fixing it required a doctor to be able to look into the vaginal canal and see the hole.

Sims didn’t want to have to look at a woman’s genitals. “If there was anything I hated, it was investigating the organs of the female pelvis,” Sims wrote in the autobiography he half completed before he died. This was a time when men and women interacted in very strict, pre-determined ways. Early illustrations from medical textbooks show doctors examining women’s pelvic areas by reaching their arms up beneath the layers of skirts and feeling around, literally blindly. A doctor was specifically instructed to reassure a female patient that he was not looking at her private parts by doing one of two things: gazing off into the distance or maintaining eye contact with her the entire time.

But when a patient came to Sims with an especially painful fistula, he wrote, “this poor girl was in such a condition that I was obliged to find out what was the matter with her.” He was eager to figure out a way to surgically seal up the hole, and happy to use slave women as his test subjects.

The idea for the speculum came to Sims while treating a white patient who had been thrown from a horse. After he helped her “reposition her uterus,” he had an idea. He fetched a slave, had her lay on her back with her legs up, and inserted the bent handle of a silver gravy spoon into her vagina. That’s right, the very first modern speculum was made out of a bent gravy spoon.

This new access allowed Sims to start performing surgery on the fistulas. Eventually he came up with a method for sealing them. He performed many of his experimental procedures without the benefit of anesthesia, and some of these slave women were operated on up to 30 times. Even at the time he was working, there were concerns about the ethics of his experiments. “All kinds of whispers were beginning to circulate around town,” wrote Seal Harris in a biography published in the 1950s, “dark rumors that it was a terrible thing for Sims to be allowed to keep on using human beings as experimental animals for his unproven surgical theories.” There is still an ongoing debate over whether or not to celebrate Sims’s legacy.

At the time, however, the larger question wasn’t about Sims’s ethical practices as much as it was about his device. The vaginal speculum set off a vigorous debate in the medical community. “Diseases of the vulva, vagina, and cervix might be better understood and more effectively treated if physicians could see these organs, but this greater understanding came at what many physicians considered to be too high a price,” Margarete Sandelowski, a women’s health expert, wrote in a paper on the history of the speculum. Doctors thought that opening up a woman’s body might corrupt those women and turn them into prostitutes or sex-crazed maniacs.

This was, after all, a time when vaginal exams were associated with prostitution and indecency. Prostitutes were often hired as model patients for doctors to practice on. “There’s this really interesting line between torture device, disciplinary device, sexual device,” says Terri Kapsalis, a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and the author of the book Public Privates: Performing Gynecology from Both Ends of the Speculum. Police officers would even leverage pelvic exams as threats against sex workers when they were arrested. Some doctors worried that using the speculum even on proper women might somehow make them sex-crazed.

In 1850, the Royal Medicine and Chirurgical Society of London held a standing-room-only meeting in which the community heard arguments for and against the speculum. These doctors worried that women would mistake the exam for a sexual experience. The British physician Robert Brudenell Carter reinforced this fear in his 1853 book, On the Pathology and Treatment of Hysteria, writing that he had “seen young unmarried women, of the middle class of society, reduced by constant use of the speculum to the mental and moral condition of prostitutes; seeking to give themselves the same indulgence by the practice of solitary vice; and asking every medical practitioner ... to institute an examination of the sexual organs.”

The speculum caught on probably for a whole number of reasons. One of them, according to Brandy Schillace, a researcher at the Dittrick Medical History Center at Case Western Reserve University, was that medical devices like the speculum and their relative the forceps helped doctors take control of an entire field: childbirth. Until the 18th century, the care of pregnant women and the birth of the child was something practiced by midwives, who were women. “Male doctors looked around and thought, ‘Hey, that’s something we should be doing,’” said Schillace. “But they couldn’t do that if everybody saw birth as being this natural thing. You needed tools and devices.” The speculum and forceps, Schillace says, weren't just tools that helped doctors open up the female body, but also tools that helped them gain control over a whole new subspecialty.

By the late 1800s childbirth and pregnancy were firmly a realm where doctors reigned and women were no longer the experts. As with many developments in medical history, the results were mixed: Doctors eventually developed medical equipment and procedures that would save many lives. But in those early days, obstetrics wasn't necessarily an improvement on midwifery. In fact, hospital births produced a much higher maternal death rate than home births because of a disease called puerperal fever that was transmitted from doctor to patient.

Over the past 150 years, medicine has advanced and doctors have become comfortable with the idea of examining a woman’s genitals. But the idea that the speculum in some way subverts female delicacy has never really died. During second-wave feminism, the speculum again became a symbol of gender roles and power. Mary Daly’s book Gyn/Ecology describes how activists of the 1970s equated gynecology with genocide and torture, seeing it as a symbol of a male-dominated society that put women in vulnerable positions (in this case, literally on their backs, naked) and made decisions about their bodies. “Women activists saw the speculum as an instrument of power that physicians used against women but which women ultimately could wrest from men,” Sandelowski writes.

In 1971, Carol Downer tried to do just that. She bought a plastic speculum, pulled out a mirror, and performed a self-exam. Downer thought women deserved to see what their doctors did—and objected to the fact that the vast majority of women (then, as now) hadn’t ever seen their own cervix. Downer invited other women to do the same. And they did. Downer also encouraged them to use the speculum to self-diagnose their own yeast infections, and encouraged home remedies like inserting yogurt into their vaginas. The medical establishment was none too pleased, and in 1972, Downer was arrested and charged with “practicing medicine without a license.”

The jurors eventually acquitted Downer, saying that they didn’t think that encouraging women to self-treat with yogurt was equivalent to practicing medicine. But feminist scholars argue that the case wasn’t really about yogurt. It was about who was allowed to wield the speculum and who wasn’t. “As these women discovered, a speculum in the hand of a woman posed a serious challenge to gynecologists, who had succeeded in claiming exclusive rights to the instrument and to diagnosing women’s maladies,” Sandelowski wrote.

The speculum we see today—that duck billed apparatus that clicks open, giving doctors a line of sight to the cervix—is fundamentally quite similar to the one Sims used on his slave women. In 1870 a man named Thomas Graves updated the device slightly, and gave us the form we see today. “That’s the one that’s stuck with us,” says Dr. Anthony Tizzano, a gynecologist at the Cleveland Clinic and collector of antique specula. Tizzano has over 100 specula, from as far back as the 1500s. He says that before Sims, there were over 200 different types of specula made for a variety of specialized tasks: placing leeches on the cervix, bloodletting the cervix, cauterizing wounds, but these were largely about delivering some kind of object or treatment, not about looking at the vagina and cervix themselves. But since Sims and Graves, the basic design hasn’t changed.

During the past decade, there has been an ongoing stream of alternative designs for the specula. And why not? Some studies suggest that women avoid and dread the pelvic exam because they hate the speculum in particular.

But not everything old is broken, and it turns out there might be a good reason to stick with the duck bill. Many of the doctors and designers I spoke with actually think the speculum is just fine, and are skeptical of the newer designs for a whole variety of reasons.

Most recent variations on the speculum work with the same central idea: inflation. Rather than having a two-part system that pushes the vaginal walls apart like an opening hand, these new devices are actually small tubes about the size of a tampon. Doctors insert the speculum into the vagina and inflate it. The air opens up the vaginal canal and exerts pressure equally on all sides of the cavity. Imagine a blood-pressure cuff, but in reverse.

In 2005, a company called FemSuite designed an inflatable speculum called FemSpec, got it approved by the FDA, and announced it would be working with Planned Parenthood to test out its invention. At the time, the device got some press. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, a patient named Maryanne Sheofsky said that the FemSpec was “the most wonderful thing in the world.” Dr. Gerald Feuer, an Atlanta-based gynecologist working with the company, told the Tribune that their device would eliminate pinching and discomfort by conforming to the natural contours of a woman’s body.

At the time, FemSuite wasn’t the only group attempting this kind of thing. A company called Doctors Research Group Inc. had created a similar device called SoftSpec and filed for a patent three years earlier. But FemSpec and SoftSpec met similar fates within just a year of each other. In 2008, Jennifer Stroud Rossmann reported in Ambidextrous Magazine that FemSpec hadn’t caught on and would no longer be available. Annie Legomsky, FemSuite’s director of marketing, told Rossmann that doctors simply didn’t want to use it. “Doctors and nurses would see it and praise it,” she said, “but then they didn’t want to take the time to learn something new.” In 2009, the rival product, SoftSpec, cancelled its own application.

When I tried to figure out if anything new had happened with either company or device during the past five years, I met with a series of bounced email addresses and research dead-ends. The patent attorney who represented a similar inflatable speculum no longer had the contact information for his client. In the end, I couldn’t find anybody associated with either SoftSpec or FemSpec to comment.

What I did find were gynecologists and medical-device designers who are working to improve pelvic exams and create better versions of the traditional speculum. They’re just not ready to ditch the fundamental, duck-billed setup just yet. “I’m not sure it’s such a badly designed device,” Kapsalis told me. “I actually think that the design is fairly simple and fairly straightforward.”

The medical establishment tends to resist change, but Kapsalis isn’t sure that was what killed the FemSpec and its competitors. “I have a feeling that if there was a design that clinicians thought was an improvement, and particularly that their patients would be happier with, that they would be willing to try it out.” She pointed out some immediate problems with the premise of an inflatable speculum. “I think, sonically, it could be kind of intense—you hear this thing that’s inflating. And from a sensory perspective, I think that it could feel really weird.”

Not only might it sound and feel weird, but the inflatable setup might actually hinder a gynecologist’s view because the tube, by definition, fills the entire canal. Being able to see the vaginal walls is important for doctors to be able to diagnose infections. Even if the tube were made of a transparent plastic, it might still conceal important symptoms.

Kapsalis also worried that an inflatable tool might not be able to stand up to the realities of a pelvic exam. “You need a device that has some guts,” she said. “It’s got to really be able to hold something open that there’s a great deal of pressure on.” The vaginal walls can exert a whole lot of force inward, and that force might be more than air can resist.

Of course, there have been improvements to Sims’s gravy spoon since the 1840s. But those improvements have built on the same basic design. Today’s specula come in a variety of sizes, for example. When the medical manufacturer Welch Allyn launched its line of specula in 1968 they came in just small and medium. In 1999, the company introduced the large. And in 2005, after hearing from doctors that sometimes even the small was a little too big, it introduced an extra small. Now it offers all four sizes in disposable, plastic form.

Otherwise, though, Welch Allyn hasn’t done much to alter the basic mechanism. Tracy Bennett, one of the company’s product managers, spends most of her time thinking about ways to improve the speculum. Her team has considered changing the duck-billed setup. “We’ve looked at different ways to maybe add a third bill, and make the two bills smaller,” she said. But these alternative designs had their own problems, and weren’t any better than the current model. “Really what we found when we got out into the market is that there really was nothing wrong. It is an old design, but there really is nothing wrong with the way it is, and with the third bill there was more chance of pinching the vaginal wall.”

Unlike Sims’s device, about half the specula in use today are made of plastic—a material that is often more practical than metal. Reusing metal specula requires thoroughly cleaning them between each patient or running the risk of spreading disease. Besides, in Kapsalis’s view, patients tend to like the plastic specula better. “Part of the thing people like better about the plastic and the metal is the warmth, and it doesn’t have this feeling of like a torture device; it’s not this clanky metal thing.”

Another benefit of plastic is the ability to integrate a light. This is what Bennett currently spends much of her time working on. Rather than forcing physicians to position an external light source so they can peer into the vaginal canal, many of Welch Allyn’s models have a light source built right into the handle of the specula where it can shine directly onto the cervix. The company’s most recent creation is a cordless, fully disposable plastic speculum with built-in lighting. The whole thing can be turned on at the beginning by pulling some tabs and thrown away when the exam is over. (Physicians who feel a twinge of guilt for throwing away all those batteries and light bulbs can remove and recycle them if they choose.)

So it’s not like the specula dropped out of the antebellum period and into your ob-gyn’s office unchanged. But these modifications have been relatively minor; the basic product still works just fine. Our technological bias may tell us that old things should be thrown out and redesigned completely—particularly when an old thing was the brainchild of a violent and sexist inventor. In the case of the speculum, however, the old thing seems to work just fine. “As you can imagine,” Bennett reminded me, “the female anatomy hasn’t changed that much.”

If the speculum isn’t the problem, why do so many women dread the pelvic exam? Kapsalis said that women who have trouble with pelvic exams are probably not suffering from a badly designed device, but rather from a badly designed patient experience.

Bennett agrees. “It’s probably more dependent on the technique of the clinician,” she said. “Or they might not be using the right size.” Bennett points out that the size of the speculum doesn’t necessarily correspond to the size of the person: Both adolescents and post-menopausal women, for example, tend to need smaller specula than middle-aged women do. Figuring out the right size can be difficult, and as a 2011 review paper on pelvic exams notes, there are no real guidelines that help practitioners figure out which size to use.

“This clanky thing comes out of a drawer and is put in their vagina before they even know what’s going on.”

Tizzano, who uses specula every day in his work as a gynecologist, says that clinicians need to remember that while they may use a speculum regularly and see the procedure as routine, their patients often don’t. “We do this all the time,” he said, “and you tend to lose some sensitivity. So you have to try to go slow and easy.” And a bad first experience can set a woman up for a lifetime of worries about pelvic exams. Even in the best of cases, though, Tizanno concedes that the examination is an invasive procedure by nature, and it’s going to feel like one. “Any time you have to dilate a body orifice and it’s not done so willingly, in the throes of passion, it’s not pleasant.”

It also turns out that much of the trouble women have with the speculum does go back to the male-dominated history of gynecology. Most women don’t really understand how the speculum works, and not all doctors do a good job of explaining what the experience is going to be like. “This clanky thing comes out of a drawer and is put in their vagina before they even know what’s going on,” Kapsalis said.

The movement in the 1970s encouraging women to buy and use their own specula did help in this regard. Kapsalis works with the Chicago Women’s Health Center, where doctors always offer women the opportunity to insert their own speculum. “That can really shift things,” she said. “Sometimes people feel much more empowered inserting their own speculum and having control over that aspect of the design. In that case, it’s not really the design of the tool but how it’s used.”

Not every woman wants to insert her own speculum, or peer at her own cervix. Kapsalis actually said that far fewer women are taking her up on the offer to insert their own speculum than they used to. But for some women—particularly those with a history of sexual violence or bad experiences with pelvic exams in the past—it can be a huge help. “If we’re going to put energy into that exam, I think more energy needs to go into the communication and the context and the sharing of power,” Kapsalis said.

So the next time you visit the gynecologist, fear not the speculum. It’s actually a well-designed tool. And it might be time to learn how to use it yourself.

## The Casualties of Women's War on Body Hair

I’m sure there was a time when I was not hairy, but I can’t remember it. I have an early memory from middle school where a doctor examined my sideburns, which stretched almost down to my jawline, and suggested some pills to slow the growth. She told me they were for people with a lot of facial hair, like me. I recall inspecting the black hairs on my legs with serious fascination; my mother would use sticky sugar to rip them out from their stubborn roots. “Beauty requires strength,” she would say, deploying an Arabic take on the more common proverb: Beauty is pain.

The regular removal of body hair is ubiquitous: More than 99 percent of American women voluntarily get rid of their hair. It’s also expensive. The American woman who shaves will spend more than $10,000 over the course of her life, and the woman who waxes will shell out more than $23,000. These habits cut across race, ethnicity, and region. They are also relatively recent.

It wasn’t until the late 1800s that non-native (mostly white) American women became concerned with body hair. In fact, as Rebecca Herzig explains in Plucked: A History of Hair Removal, “18th-century naturalists and explorers considered hair-free skin to be a strange obsession of indigenous peoples.” English colonists were surprised and disturbed by beardless Native Americans when they first landed.

How then, in the span of less than a century, did the unnatural state of hairlessness become the standard for American women?

The campaign against body hair on women originates in Darwin’s 1871 book Descent of Man, explains Herzig. Men of science obsessed over racial differences in hair type and growth (among other aspects of physical appearance), and as the press popularized these findings, the broader American public latched on. Darwin’s evolutionary theory transformed body hair into a question of competitive selection—so much so that hairiness was deeply pathologized. “Rooted in traditions of comparative racial anatomy, evolutionary thought solidified hair’s associations with ‘primitive’ ancestry and an atavistic return to earlier, ‘less developed’ forms,” Herzig writes. Post-Descent, hairiness became an issue of fitness.

An important distinction in this evolutionary framework was that men were supposed to be hairy, and women were not. Scientists surmised that a clear distinction between the masculine and the feminine indicated “higher anthropological development” in a race. So, hairiness in women became indicative of deviance, and researchers set out to prove it. Herzig tells the story of an 1893 study of 271 cases of insanity in white women, which found that insane women had excessive facial hair more frequently than the sane. Their hairs were also “thicker and stiffer,” more closely resembling those of the “inferior races.” Havelock Ellis, the scholar of human sexuality, claimed that this type of hair growth in women was “linked to criminal violence, strong sexual instincts … [and] exceptional ‘animal vigor.’”

By the early 1900s, unwanted hair was a significant source of discomfort for American women. They desired smooth, sanitized, white skin. They wanted to be feminine. “In a remarkably short time, body hair became disgusting to middle-class American women, its removal a way to separate oneself from cruder people, lower class and immigrant,” writes Herzig.

As hemlines rose, threatening to reveal hairy limbs, women took extreme measures to remove hair.

In the 1920s and ’30s, women used pumice stones or sandpaper to depilate, which caused irritation and scabbing. Some tried modified shoemaker’s waxes. Thousands were killed or permanently disabled by Koremlu, a cream made from the rat poison thallium acetate. It was successful in eliminating hair, and also in causing muscular atrophy, blindness, limb damage, and death. Around the same time, X-ray hair removal emerged as another treatment option. Women would sit for three or four minutes in front of the invisible rays of a boxed X-ray machine, and the radiation would do its work. So great was the appeal of each hair withering away in its sheath that for nearly two decades, women underwent dangerous radiation that led to scarring, ulceration, and cancer.

It’s not a coincidence that the pressure for women to modify their body hair has risen in tandem with their liberties.

Disfigured and dying, but undeterred, women continued the war on body hair. Concurrently, Gillette had slowly been mastering its marketing of razors. During World War II, there was a shortage of the thick stockings that women wore to cover their hairy legs, and shaving—something that had previously been associated with men’s routines—became a common practice for women. By 1964, 98 percent of American women were routinely shaving their legs, embracing the repetitive swiping that defines modern hair removal. But alternate methods still proliferated in laboratories and physicians’ offices. In the 1960s and ’70s, doctors began prescribing hormonal drugs, like Aldactone and Androcur (which are now often used in male-to-female transitions), to combat hirsutism—the slippery and subjective condition of excessive hair growth in women. The side effects of this hormone therapy can include cancer, stroke, and heart attack, and its effectiveness in reducing hair growth is inconsistent.

Today, women still engage in risky, time-consuming, and skin-damaging practices to rid our bodies of hair. Laser hair removal can cause severe burns, blistering, and scarring. Waxing is painful and unsanitary. Bleaching can irritate and discolor your skin. And there’s a whole Reddit thread for what to do if you burn your vagina with Nair. These products are largely unregulated, as most cosmetics tend to be.

Hair removal, at its core, is a form of gendered social control. It’s not a coincidence that the pressure for women to modify their body hair has risen in tandem with their liberties, Herzig argues. She writes that the effect of this hairlessness norm is to “produce feelings of inadequacy and vulnerability, the sense that women’s bodies are problematic the way they naturally are.”

And yet, if you ask many women why they voluntarily shave or wax, they might say that it’s a method of self-enhancement. That they want to, it’s a personal choice, and they just feel better when everything is smooth. Hair removal as self-care might be one of the biggest lies women have bought into. It keeps us in an impossible loop, one in which we are constantly in pursuit of velvety limbs and the moral virtue of cleanliness.

A few years ago, I got my sideburns lasered, along with the rest of my face, my armpits, my back, my stomach, the back of my neck, and the soft expanse underneath my chin. I zapped the hair right at the follicle, before it even had the chance to break through my skin. It hurt, but the good kind, the kind of pain women are taught is worth it.

## The Still-Misunderstood Shape of the Clitoris

The clitoris really isn’t that confusing. Or it shouldn’t be, anyway. Nonetheless, acknowledging the shape, size, or even existence of this essential body part has not always been par for the course—even in the medical profession. As a 2005 report from the American Urological Association puts it, “the anatomy of the clitoris has not been stable with time as would be expected. To a major extent its study has been dominated by social factors.”

However, heralded by some as a sexual and physiological revolution, a new 3-D printed model of the clitoris is being used to change the public’s view of female sexuality. Free to download, the life-size model was designed by the French engineer, sociologist, and independent researcher Odile Fillod and released early last year.

At 10 centimeters in length, from the tip of the glans to the end of one “crus” (or leg), the model clitoris is bigger than expected. That’s tactical: It was created to dispel misinformation. Many dictionaries and even medical texts dub the clitoris as “pea-sized.”

Historical accounts of the clitoris are plagued by disparagement or ignorance. Though Magnus, a renowned scholar in the Middle Ages, considered the clitoris as homologous to the penis, not all who succeeded him agreed. In the 16th century, Vesalius argued the clitoris did not appear in “healthy women.” The Malleus Maleficarum, a 1486 guide for finding witches, suggested the clitoris was the “devil’s teat”; if the tissue were to be found on a woman it would prove her status as a witch. And in the 1800s, women seen as suffering from “hysteria” were sometimes subject to clitoridectomies.

It wasn’t until 1981 that the Federation of Feminist Women’s Health Clinics created anatomically correct images of the clitoris. Published in A New View of a Woman’s Body, the images were part of a wider attempt to provide thorough, accurate information to women to support their health. Decades later, in 2009, the first 3-D sonography of the stimulated clitoris was completed by French Researchers.

Ignorance persists today. As the University of Western Sydney clinician and physiotherapy researcher Jane Chalmers explains, the subject of the clitoris is still avoided or ignored. “Several major medical textbooks omit the clitoris, or label it on diagrams but have no description of it as an organ,” she says. “This is in great contrast to the penis that is always covered in-depth in these texts.”

As a researcher who focuses on the vulva and pelvis as well, Chalmers says she is often harassed online. “I frequently face questions of ‘Why would you want to study that?’ and snide comments along the lines of, ‘She must be a lesbian.’”

“The clitoris is never correctly pictured in the drawings showing the female genital apparatus.”

The problem, many suggest, starts early. A recent research paper examined 55 qualitative studies in more than 10 countries. Its authors found that young people tend to have negative views of the sex education they received in school. The researchers noted that many students reported that very little was ever said about sexual pleasure, female pleasure in particular.

In France, where the model clitoris originates, sex education often teaches outdated attitudes, according to Fillod. Official guidelines for sex ed are “terribly sexist, heteronormative, even homophobic,” she says. In particular, social norms are often inaccurately linked to biological information. For example, Fillod explains that children are taught “that boys are more focused on genital sexuality, whereas girls care more about love and the quality of relationships, in part because of their ‘specific anatomical-physiological characteristics.’” She is not alone in her concern about this curriculum. In 2015 the Haut Conseil à l’Egalité, a government body that monitors gender equality, reported that school-based sex education in France was riddled with sexism.

Determined to do something about the problem, Fillod partnered with a Toulouse-based documentary-film production company to prepare a series of videos with alternative materials. In the process, Fillod realized that a life-size 3-D model of the clitoris would be a useful visual aid. “In French biology textbooks,” she explains, “the clitoris is never correctly pictured in the drawings showing the female genital apparatus, and even quite often not pictured at all.”

As an engineer at the École Centrale Paris, who has been independently researching sex and gender issues in biomedical science since 2013, Fillod was prepared for the task. “Providing a free and open-access model that could be 3-D printed by anyone appeared as an ideal solution,” she says. “It would not be just for me and this video, but for anyone wanting to use such a 3-D model for educative purposes.”

Before she could create a model, Fillod had to understand what was known about the clitoris. A review of available scientific literature provided Fillod with a defined shape and realistic average size of the clitoris and bulbs. With the dimensions understood, Fillod collaborated with the fablab at the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie in Paris, a scientific museum. They helped her transform the data into the stylized printable model.

The model can be downloaded and output by anyone with access to a 3-D printer. It is “anatomically correct, life-size, and in 3-D, which is far superior to the drawings that are generally available,” Fillod says. That a life-size clitoris is 10 centimeters may be the first shock—but the wishbone-like shape of the organ is certainly the second.

Fillod says she hopes the model will help spread better knowledge of women’s genital anatomy. It might be used for sex ed in schools, for one. But everyone else who might encounter a clitoris has something to learn from the model too. Chalmers explains that understanding this “neat little organ” is important because medical professionals are now beginning to appreciate that it has a role in immune health. Being able to identify and understand the clitoris means knowing when something is wrong—both for women and for their doctors.

Considering the fact that clitoral pain (as well as infections, inflammation, and disease) are quite common, Chalmers contends that better understanding of the clitoris is essential. She adds that as the clitoris is closely tied to female sexual pleasure, the lack of knowledge about it amplifies inequality for women.

That may be about to change. According to Fillod, sex therapists, sex educators, school nurses, biology teachers, and sex-information institutions have all shown interest in using the model. And some French schools have already adopted it, although Fillod expects sex-educational use will not be widespread unless the Minister for Education supports the idea. Nonetheless, the model is sure to start conversations, even just among those who read about it. The size and shape present an anatomical reality that is more difficult to ignore than a small drawing or written description. As the American Urological Association concluded in 2005, “It is impossible to convey clitoral anatomy in a single diagram.”

Further afield from France, global media coverage of the model reveals an interest in knowing more about the clitoris. But the same cultural preconceptions that inspired the model have attached themselves to its reception. “Some of the journalists who interviewed me and published a paper about it clearly wanted to send some kind of message,” Fillod says, mentioning myriad examples of different motives attached to what should be a scientific model. “My concerns about this misinformation are mainly about the creation of new urban legends which reinforce gender stereotypes and the sex dichotomy.”

Though misconceptions inevitably will continue, Fillod’s model is not alone in battling the lack of “cultural cliteracy,” as it has become known. Cliteracy, a project led by the artist Sophia Wallace, explores the history of the clitoris, the myths around it, and an introduction to the artists who have challenged misconceptions of the past.

As for the model, there is more to be done. The 3-D printing lab where it was generated hopes that a future a model might depict the pelvic bones, the clitoris, and the vagina. They believe that a more complex model would more reveal how the clitoris fits into the whole of the female genitalia, whether for stimulation or general health. They hope that future models could be printed in “a flexible material to approximate the anatomical reality.”

But it’s possible that further realism won’t help matters. While a model clitoris can clarify the form of the organ in the abstract, it might smack of scientism to believe that an accurate model of a body part would magically clarify how it fits into the lived experience of the human beings who possesses it. A more complex model could be useful, in other words, but it is unlikely to help the clitoris escape its troubled history. As Fillod’s model has shown, anatomically correct information can help those willing to learn. But for those predisposed to misconception, an anatomically correct, scientifically rendered 3-D model might reinforce that bias, rather than rectify it.

## The Environmental Cost of Internet Porn

So many people watch porn online that the industry’s carbon footprint might be worse now that it was in the days of DVDs and magazines.

Online streaming is a win for the environment. Streaming music eliminates all that physical material—CDs, jewel cases, cellophane, shipping boxes, fuel—and can reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 40 percent or more. Video streaming is still being studied, but the carbon footprint should similarly be much lower than that of DVDs.

Scientists who analyze the environmental impact of the internet tout the benefits of this “dematerialization,” observing that energy use and carbon-dioxide emissions will drop as media increasingly can be delivered over the internet. But this theory might have a major exception: porn.

Since the turn of the century, the pornography industry has experienced two intense hikes in popularity. In the early 2000s, broadband enabled higher download speeds. Then, in 2008, the advent of so-called tube sites allowed users to watch clips for free, like people watch videos on YouTube. Adam Grayson, the chief financial officer of the adult company Evil Angel, calls the latter hike “the great mushroom-cloud porn explosion of 2008.”

Precise numbers don’t exist to quantify specifics, but the impression across the industry is that viewership is way, way up. Pornhub, the world’s most popular porn site, provides some of the only accessible data on its yearly web-traffic report. The first “Year in Review” post in 2013 tabulated that people visited the site 14.7 billion times. By 2016, that number had almost doubled, to 23 billion, and those visitors watched more than 4.59 billion hours of porn. And Pornhub is just one site.

Is pornography in the digital era leaving a larger carbon footprint than it did during the days of magazines and videos? Obtaining raw numbers will always be a sticking point, because the stigmatized industry has never kept track of sales like the music and film industries, and has no significant archives. But if pornography experts’ estimates are accurate, they suggest a rare scenario where digitization might have increased the overall consumption of porn so much that the principal of dematerialization gets flipped on its head. The internet could allow people to spend so much time looking at porn that it’s actually worse for the environment.

Using a formula that Netflix published on its blog in 2015, Nathan Ensmenger, a professor at Indiana University who is writing a book about the environmental history of the computer, calculates that if Pornhub streams video as efficiently as Netflix (0.0013 kWh per streaming hour), it used 5.967 million kWh in 2016. For comparison, that’s about the same amount of energy 11,000 light bulbs would use if left on for a year. And operating with Netflix’s efficiency would be a best-case scenario for the porn site, Ensmenger believes.

Grayson says he has witnessed this explosion of growth firsthand at Evil Angel. He estimates that the site’s viewership has increased by 7,000 percent since the time of DVDs. In the late 1990s, he says, a new Evil Angel DVD would sell approximately 7,500 copies in the first 30 days. Now, he says, Evil Angel videos are streamed 30,000 times in the first 30 days—and that only represents the 5 percent of its web traffic comprised of paying customers. Each week, 2 million free previews are watched. “There’s no way, 15 years ago, at the peak of physical media, that many people were touching our brand,” he says.

Still, it’s impossible to access any data for the porn industry as a whole. Trade magazines like Variety or Billboard don’t exist, and sales records have never been archived. For Jon Koomey, a data scientist who studies the environmental impact of the internet, this lack of information hamstrings any serious inquiry. Although the estimates sound reasonable to him, and he believes pornography very well could provide an exception to the rule of dematerialization, he warns against speculative comparisons. “I don’t even know what fraction of the internet is porn,” he says. “And without data, it’s hard to say anything sensible.”

Koomey warns that there are simply too many variables to be considered. For instance, the growth of porn consumption since the turn of the century would have to be compared to the growth of all internet data during the same time period. The energy and emissions for manufacturing, marketing, transporting, and using porn DVDs would have to be compared to the electricity required to make a search-engine query, the electricity used by the device making the search, and the operational cost of the website’s server, network, and specific data center.

Gail Dines, a sociologist who studies pornography, agrees that precise numbers would be impossible to find. But as an anti-pornography advocate, she views the potential environmental costs of such rabid online consumption as an important critique against the industry. She is sure that online pornography is much more popular, and attributes this growth to what she calls the principle of the “three As”: affordability, accessibility, and anonymity. “The more anonymous you make porn, the more affordable, the more accessible, the more you drive demand,” she says.

In her view, each new technology heightens the three As. Mobile phones, which can be viewed anywhere, are more private than desktop computers, DVDs, and VHSs, which must be viewed in a home. Those, in turn, are more private than an adult theater. Consumption has also become more anonymous as tube sites like Pornhub require no log-in or credit-card information. There is no fear of being seen by a neighbor at a sex shop.

All the researchers I spoke to would love to have access to reliable data. The sociologist Chauntelle Tibbals believes in the educational benefits of pornography, but she has qualms with the industry’s exploitative practices, and therefore has misgivings about using numbers provided by Pornhub. She notes that Pornhub is part of a vast porn empire called MindGeek, which quietly controls almost all of the free tube sites and an increasing number of production companies. Tibbals believes Pornhub releases these numbers—and engages in promotional activities like a recent offer of free snow removal in Boston—as an attempt to normalize itself and to shift the focus away from rampant piracy issues and accusations of promoting sexual violence against women. (Pornhub did not respond to a request for an interview.)

Although their numbers could be accurate, Tibbals believes trusting them without access to company records would be naïve, akin to trusting numbers published in brochures by companies like Goldman Sachs or Exxon. For that reason, she says a huge asterisk must be placed beside them in any serious effort to comprehend their impact. It’s possible Pornhub’s data is not reflective of the adult industry, but only of adult piracy sites.

Ensmenger, the Indiana University historian, agrees that the numbers are nebulous at best. But like Dines, he still thinks these questions are worth asking, even if only to raise awareness that internet porn does take an environmental toll. While Pornhub may be using an enormous amount of electricity, “none of us are paying that electrical bill in any way that impacts our behavior,” he says.

For Ensmenger, this epitomizes the problem with the digital economy, where so many of the costs are outsourced or hidden that consumers believe everything is free. Most sites offer their free videos by selling advertising to companies that track consumer behavior, and these cookies require a considerable amount of energy. More importantly, consumers don’t have to think about the significant environmental costs of constructing and destructing electrical products, such as screens, servers, and hard drives.

A notion like dematerialization, Ensmenger says, can often be a myth that Silicon Valley tells itself, without acknowledging that the region contains the country’s highest number of EPA Superfund sites, where the federal government must clean up hazardous pollutants and contaminants.

Even if consumers don’t pay the electric bill, somebody must. “With digital things, it’s just so easy to externalize the costs to other places, other actors, that we make assumptions about them being less environmentally impactful that are just not justified,” Ensmenger says.

## Porn’s Uncanny Valley

“It’s a phantom-limb penis syndrome,” said a tall, British man who goes by the name Adam Sutra. Adam is the CEO of CamasutraVR, a company that makes, among other products, virtual-reality pornography. He was trying to explain to me what it’s like when you’re a man, you’re immersed in virtual reality, and you look down at yourself.

Adam works in a downtown Los Angeles loft that was arranged like any start-up with ambitious goals. High ceilings, concrete floors, and skateboards leaning against a wall upon which hung a poster for the indie rock band Pavement. Outside, there was the clamor of construction in a neighborhood busily gentrifying. Inside, the late-morning sunlight illuminated the room.

On the computer screen before us, a 3-D rendering of a naked man was stomping around a virtual apartment. “I’m now in the body of a black, male performer with a 12-inch penis,” Adam announced. The virtual apartment’s decor was banal: a white coffee table next to a sofa, a bowl of oranges on the kitchen counter, an Oriental rug on the floor. But in the main room, the real porn star Casey Calvert had been digitally scanned and recreated as a digital doppelgänger. She was dancing around a stripper pole, grinding to the ominous chords of Metallica’s “Enter Sandman.”

For the new pornographers like Adam Sutra, technology can erase the material world. In virtual reality, there are no limits, not even when it comes to sex. “If you can meet in your virtual-reality space, anything’s possible,” Adam observed coolly as the man bore down upon the woman, her prerecorded moans filling the air.

Porn wasn’t always like this. It used to be real. Real people made real porn movies on real movie sets in the San Fernando Valley, earning the area the nickname “Porn Valley.” Now virtual reality is their competition. Start-up bros with computer-science degrees and blockchain fetishes are hoping they can sell virtual sex to the masses.

Whether or not people get turned on by VR pornography, the technology is changing the places where adult content has traditionally been created. Porn Valley is being displaced by porn’s uncanny valley—an X-rated version of the theory holding that a robotic or simulated entity that appears to be human, but not quite fully human, revolts us. Losing a connection to the material world—the skin and sweat of reality—may also lose what makes porn alluring.

The 1960s and ’70s were the Golden Age of Porn. Back then, adult movies were shot on film and the business of producing pornographic movies was decentralized, operating primarily out of New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In the ’80s, adult-movie production was centralized in the San Fernando Valley, northwest of the Los Angeles Basin. Cheap rent and the proximity to the entertainment industry made for an ideal location. Porn Valley was born.

In 1998, I moved from the San Francisco Bay Area, where I was born and raised, to Los Angeles. I was a freelance journalist with an interest in the adult-movie industry. By then, the business had grown exponentially. The barrier to entry was lower due to the newly affordable video camera, the internet was delivering adult content directly into consumers’ homes for the first time in history, and a two-term liberal administration in the White House and an attorney general who had little interest in pursuing federal obscenity prosecutions had combined to create an “anything goes” atmosphere in the manufacturing of pornography. Business was booming.

Every so often, I headed over the Cahuenga Pass and descended into the Valley, where I watched as porn movies were shot in rented, ranch-style homes and on massive soundstages, as cowboy-boots-wearing adult-talent agents in wood-paneled offices hosted cattle calls in search of fresh-off-the-bus talent, as cavernous warehouses were stocked to the rafters with dirty movies.

When I moved back to Los Angeles last year, I rented an apartment in the Valley. I wanted to know what had become of the adult-movie business. As it turned out, Porn Valley had changed. Technology had transformed it. A perfect storm had slammed the industry. The Great Recession had hit it hard, a handful of federal obscenity prosecutions during the Bush administration had caused a chilling effect, and widespread digital-content pirating had oversaturated the market and devalued the product, decimating the competition and slashing profits by the double digits. Once upon a time, porn had led technology, adopting VHS over Betamax in the video-format wars of the late ’70s and ’80s. In the new millennium, technology was porn’s undoing.

Could technology transform porn once again?

With an Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset strapped to my head, I wandered through Adam Sutra’s virtual apartment. The man with the 12-inch penis was nowhere to be found. At the window, the nighttime skyline glittered on the other side of the glass. I looked down at my virtual hands, controlled by my haptic gloves, opening and closing them. In the kitchen, I picked up a red gun that I’d seen the man use. In the living room, I aimed the gun at Casey as she danced. Then I pulled the trigger. A shower of dollars bills rained down on her. I reached out and touched her breast; the flesh depressed. She looked real, but I couldn’t feel her. Moments later, the man reappeared, but when they had sex, I wasn’t able to shift my virtual perspective to his point of view, due to an unresolved bug in the programming’s software.

Adam and his team had spent a year building a virtual porn world “the size of Grand Theft Auto,” but the technology wasn’t perfect yet. No matter. Their population was growing. They were scanning more porn stars and shooting adult performers in motion-capture suits bouncing lustily on top of each other in an array of sexual positions. The results were impressive. Casey’s skin was eerily lifelike, porous and pliant. Their genitals were, well, sufficiently realistic. (“It’s easier to do a hard penis than a vagina,” Adam confided.) There was something disconcerting about the simulacrum of Casey, though, especially in her face, which was weirdly human and disturbingly not, more uncanny valley than Porn Valley.

CamasutraVR’s rendering of Casey Calvert’s face (CamasutraVR)

The scenery changed, and the man moved aggressively through a dimly lit strip club with red velvet seating and a full bar. Casey reappeared, and the two had sex as I watched. Abruptly the man’s penis detached itself from its host. Seconds later, the disembodied phallus reappeared. It had transposed itself onto Casey’s stomach. The effect was disturbing. In the uncanny valley of virtual sex, bodies can break into pieces as quickly as desire can be transformed into revulsion.

On a recent Saturday morning, I took a drive around the city. I wanted to see how technology had altered the landscape of pornography in the real world. When I first became interested in Porn Valley years ago, I used to take photos of adult storefronts. In my mind, the stores inhabited the same interstitial space porn did in America’s collective unconscious. They were everywhere and nowhere, brick-and-mortar structures people walked past but pretended didn’t exist, their X-rated wares as ubiquitous as they were invisible.

At Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue, Le Sex Shoppe was gone—a Yelp reviewer had once claimed it was “the poet Charles Bukowski’s porn shop of choice back in the day.” It has been replaced by a Petco. At Western and Sunset Boulevard, the X-rated Pussycat Theater was no more. An apartment building and a Walgreens stand in its place. On Santa Monica Boulevard, near the 101 Freeway, the Tiki Theater was still standing. Years ago, I’d photographed it, but I’d never been inside. “It’s porn movies,” the man in the front booth emphasized when I paid my $14. “I know,” I replied. In the gloom of the tiny theater, four men were scattered around on random chairs. On the big screen, a cheery blonde was performing oral sex on a man who seemed to be appreciating the attention. On the TV set that had been erected next to the bigger screen, a different porn movie was playing. Neither one had sound. It was not quite 9 o’clock in the morning. In this hidden world, the porn was real—almost too real.

From there, I made my way into the Valley. Years earlier, I’d visited the talent agent Jim South at his World Modeling Talent Agency on Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, but an insurance company appeared to occupy the space. Down the block, I ducked into Romantix, an adult store, to see if virtual reality had hit the retail market. Amidst the DVDs and adult toys, I located a lone virtual-reality experience offering. On the box, a man with impressive abdominal muscles had donned virtual-reality goggles and inserted his penis into a black, plastic device that resembled an oversized hand weight. Behind the counter, the salesman I’d asked about the virtual-reality porn selection was attempting to predict if the future of pornography would work for him. “My one eye’s messed up, so my depth perception is off, so I don’t know if I can even do it,” he mused to his female coworker, who said nothing.

Today a new generation of hipper, shrewder, and more digitally minded pornographers is making money at making porn in the San Fernando Valley. They’ve learned discerning consumers are overwhelmed by the glut of low-quality and frequently pirated dreck on adult tube sites. People are willing to pay for high production values, compelling storylines, and whatever sates their fetishes.

Last November, I visited one such porn set. The shooting location was a house that was on the market for a few million dollars, and the plotline concerned itself with two women who were supposed to work together but ended up having sex instead. To film the sex scene, the crew crammed into a small guest bedroom. Someone had blocked the window so the neighbors wouldn’t know a porn movie was being made on a suburban street with a spectacular view of the sprawling valley floor. I watched from the bathroom; there was nowhere else to stand. The cameras recorded. The director directed. The nude girls writhed on the bed, intertwining and unwinding. There was nothing virtual about it: not the floral bedspread, not the faint scent of their feminine exertions, not the point at which the blonde lay on her back during a break in the action and hugged her legs into herself. It was endearing in its realness.

Porn Valley is real, but you’ll never find it on a map. It has its own population, laws, and language. Reviled by outsiders and misunderstood by most, it depends upon the fickle fantasies of those who consume it and staves off attacks by those who believe it a social menace. It has thrived during economic booms and survived economic downturns. But due to our own conflicted relationship to sex and pornography, people pretend as if this very real place doesn’t exist.

For me, its streets are a maze of memories. There’s the soundstage where a famous male porn star, full of confidence and bravado, informed me: “If I was a billionaire, I would still do porn.” There’s the warehouse in which I spotted a giant vagina costume lurking in the shadows. There’s the building in which, not long ago, I witnessed a cherubic porn star burst into tears during an audition because she had forgotten the single line of dialogue she was supposed to memorize. It’s a place where you can lose yourself. For a while I did. Sometimes I still do.

I always intended to write a book about Porn Valley, but it never really happened. I guess you could say my life got in the way. At one point, I put together a book proposal about the adult-movie business, but no editor in the New York publishing industry wanted to buy it. Why would anyone want to read a book about the porn industry, one editor wondered, when you could watch porn on the internet for free?

Today the adult-production-company studio system that spawned crossover stars like Jenna Jameson have ceded ground to surveillance-filled houses stocked with cam-girl performers and amateur starlets who charge online customers for bespoke experiences and accept cryptocurrency. A few years ago, a law requiring the use of condoms on adult movies shot in Los Angeles County passed, sending the adult industry back to the place from whence it had come: the underground.

“Everyone wants to feel something,” Adam Sutra told me of his experiments in virtual pornography. He’s right about that. Porn isn’t about sex at all, I’ve learned. It’s about wanting to feel something. And until technology figures out how to make me feel the way that I do when I’m on a porn set, I’ll leave virtual-reality sex to the start-up boys.

## Nobody Uses Dental Dams

The students have survived watching their teacher demonstrate how to put a condom on a “wooden penis model.” They’ve been assigned homework to find examples of contraception use in sex scenes in movies or TV shows. But before they go, they have one final lesson, one last barrier method for their teacher to sheepishly explain: the dental dam, a latex sheet used as a barrier during oral sex.

According to a sex-education curriculum used by school districts in San Diego, Boston, Portland, and elsewhere, their teacher would show them how to remove a dam from its package and place it over genitalia by forming an “O” with their hand. The instructor would inform the students that dental dams are flavored, and that they should only be used once and then thrown away. Most important, the teacher would instruct them to always use dental dams when performing oral sex on women, or they’ll be at risk of transmitting STIs.There’s just one problem: The pupils are unlikely to ever take their teacher up on the suggestion. Even the teachers, preaching about the dangers of STIs, have probably never bought one themselves.

Read: The enduring unpopularity of the female condom

Carol Queen, a staff sexologist for the sex-shop chain Good Vibrations, says the company sells less than 600 dams per month in the United States, across 13 stores and its website. Mary Jane Minkin, a clinical professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the Yale University School of Medicine, puts it more simply: “Nobody is using them.”

It might seem like that would spell doom for the dental dam. But it has managed to live on: first as a staple of sex education, but now as a symbol of sex positivity for queer women—whether or not anybody ever uses them.

Sanford Barnum invented the rubber dental dam in 1864 to isolate individual teeth from saliva during dental surgery. For more than a century, the product’s use seems to have been limited to dental operations. But in the late 1980s, as millions of gay men began dying of AIDS, safe-sex advocates adopted the dental dam for an entirely new purpose.

It’s not clear who initiated this reinvention, which appears in records of gay media and activism as early as 1988. Clive Woodworth, the managing director of the Australian condom-manufacturing company Glyde Health, claims he invented the modern dental dam in 1993 after lesbians asked him for their own safe-sex product.

“They didn’t understand why companies like mine were selling sexual-health products for everyone but lesbians,” Woodworth says. “They were tired of cutting up condoms and saran wrap because they didn’t like the idea of fluid being transmitted without a barrier.”

At this time, there was no scientific consensus around HIV transmission, so as the epidemic killed millions of gay men, gay women thought they might be next.

“Lesbians were like, ‘Hey, we need services too! We don’t know what we need them for, but we need them,’” says Katie Batza, the author of Before AIDS.

In the nearly four decades since, science has shown that HIV is practically impossible to transmit between women, and dental dams were more a product of AIDS panic than of genuine medical necessity. But dental dams are still around, even if not because of consumer demand.

Their potential to prevent more common STDs has gone largely unrealized. Juliet Richters, a former professor of sexual health at the University of New South Wales, is one of few researchers who have performed quantitative research on dental-dam use. In one of her studies, she found that among 330 Australian women who had sex with women, only 9.7 percent had ever used a dental dam, and just 2.1 percent used them often. In another study, Richters found that only 4 percent of women prisoners in New South Wales had used the device. For context, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, 93 percent of American women who have had sexual intercourse have used a condom at least once, though just 17 percent of people had used a condom for oral sex.

Richters wasn’t surprised by the results; she had never thought that dental dams were widely used. “They used to give out dental dams at lesbian events, but nobody took them,” Richters says. “You’d find them all left on the floor.”

From a medical perspective, it makes sense that dental dams aren’t highly sought after. Cunnilingus is one of the safest forms of sex in terms of STD transmission. Minkin, the Yale School of Medicine professor, says this is likely because the labia tissue is more similar to external skin than the internal tissue exposed during anal or vaginal sex, and thus less susceptible to STD transmission.

Sexually transmitted diseases and infections such as gonorrhea, herpes, and HPV can still be transmitted via oral sex, though the HPV vaccine adds another level of safety against that virus; 66 percent of adolescents now get the vaccine, which should reduce the risk of exposure via oral sex over time.

“If we can’t even get people to use condoms all the time, even when pregnancy is at stake, dental dams are a tough sell,” Minkin says. And compared with condoms, which are ubiquitous in pharmacies and convenience stores, dental dams are generally only available online or in sex shops. They’re pricey, too—often more than twice as expensive as condoms.

They are also awkward, both to talk about and to use, says Chris Barcelos, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who researches safe sex in queer communities. “People say dental dams take the fun out of oral sex,” Barcelos says. “You lose a lot of sensation and pleasure when you give or receive oral sex with a dam.” Jay Botsford, the co-host of the Queer Sex Ed podcast, agrees. “The people I know who’ve tried them really hated them, because they were just uncomfortable and awkward to use. It’s obvious that they weren’t made for sex,” Botsford says. Some new, speculative designs for dental dams are trying to solve those problems; among them is a dam in the form of women’s underwear. But that product hasn’t yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a viable way to prevent disease.

So if dental dams aren’t widely used, accessible, pleasurable, or necessary to protect against serious STD risk, it could make sense to leave them in the past, a footnote in the history of the 1980s. But young people often still learn about them in sex ed.

Students in Farmington, Michigan, learn about the proper use of dental dams for oral sex. Students in Washoe County, Nevada, are reminded to check the expiration date of their dental dams, and store them in a cool place. Students in Kentucky public schools learn that having oral sex without a dental dam is unsafe and that dental dams help prevent HIV transmission, and students in Los Angeles learn that Saran wrap can be used in a pinch as a dental-dam substitute.

The decentralization of American education makes it practically impossible to know how many schools across the country teach about dental dams, or when they entered the sex-education canon, explains Alexandra Lord, the author of Condom Nation. The Centers for Disease Control recommends dental-dam use, but it does not mention dental dams in its study of school sex-education-program curricula around the United States.

Planned Parenthood includes dental dams as a consistent component of its curricula. “A big part of Planned Parenthood’s sex-education value system is helping young people make their own decisions,” says Julia Bennett, the director of learning strategy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “For some people, dental dams might make a lot of sense, but for other people, other safer-sex methods might be more useful to them. It’s not up to us to make that decision for them.” The sex educator Karen Rayne agrees, noting that while she knows people don’t really use dental dams, she’s still wary of cutting them out of her curricula. “I would never want someone to contract an STI because I didn’t teach them about dental dams,” she says.

This is the common justification for including dental dams in sex ed: There’s no harm. But some people feel uncomfortable advocating for a product they know is rarely actually used. “There’s this inside joke among sex educators that part of our job is to tell people about dental dams, when nobody is actually using them,” Barcelos says. They worry they’ll be seen as hypocritical, advocating for a supposedly safer option while ignoring the fact that the option is rarely actually exercised. “We’re taught to impose this pressure to use dental dams, even though nobody does, including us,” Botsford adds.

Botsford believes sex educators are taught to emphasize STD prevention in this way because of a preoccupation with negative sex outcomes rather than pleasure. “We don’t blame people for getting cancer or getting the flu; we blame the existence of those illnesses. But with STIs, the problem isn’t the existence of the virus: It’s the fact that you had sex and you didn’t do the things you should have done.”

This fixation on the potential harms of sex is embedded in the basic structure of sex education, says Jessica Halem, who does outreach for the Harvard Medical School’s Sexual and Gender Minorities Health Equity Initiative.

“Sex education should center pleasure, and disease and infection conversations should happen with pediatricians,” Halem says. “Why don’t we talk about HPV alongside the flu? They’re both illnesses that can be vaccinated against, but only one of them is all wrapped up in anxiety about sex. If you reframe sex education [around] pleasure, a lot of this stuff just seems silly. Can people even achieve orgasm with a dental dam? I have no idea.”

Halem argues that dental dams should be struck from curricula entirely. “If you only have a short period of time to educate young people about sex, dental dams should not be taking up any of those precious moments,” Halem says. “I just really don’t want anybody not having oral sex because they can’t find a dental dam. My god, that’s a tragedy!”

Even if no one uses them, dental dams can still serve a purpose. To some, the existence of dental dams is a validation of a type of sex often minimized or ignored.

“There’s a broader cultural idea that lesbian sex is a joke, and that when queer women have sex, they’re just gently rubbing up against each other or something,” Barcelos says. “Using things like dental dams is one way to establish that [lesbian] sex is really sex. If you need a product, that makes it real.”

Read: LGBT students are not safe at school

Maureen Kelly, the founder of Planned Parenthood’s LGBT Health & Wellness program, has noticed the impact of that validation firsthand. She’s had young queer people in her sex-ed classrooms come thank her for talking about dental dams, as even just mentioning the existence of dental dams acknowledges a type of sex that centers both women’s pleasure and queer identity.

“Young queer kids in particular are very attuned to whether or not their identities are being included in an education setting,” Kelly says. “When they notice that they are seen, that makes a huge difference and can go a long way in education.” For Kelly, that might be reason enough to keep dental dams around: They can be symbols of security and validation, even if nobody is actually using them.

## A High-School Porn Star’s Cry for Help

Stockton, California, is inland, hot, 20 percent poor, and crime-ridden. The top nine employers are schools, hospitals, the government, and Amazon, which has two giant fulfillment centers in the city. No. 10 is O’Reilly Auto Parts. It’s a good place to leave, if you can. As ever in places like this, the high schools are full of trouble and promise, and one of them—Bear Creek High School—has lately been in the news because of two of its students: Bailey Kirkeby, a junior, and Caitlin Fink, a senior.

They are thoroughly creatures of the modern age, but what impresses me about both of them is how deeply they also exemplify some of the most enduring traits of girlhood. They are hopeful, concerned about fairness, foursquare on the side of the underdog, and drenched in a romantic vision of life, in which sorrows can be easily overcome and infinite happiness is always on the horizon. Like every girl since the beginning of history—and surely, to the last syllable of recorded time—they are subjects of great interest to people who don’t mean them well. Let’s get to know them a bit.

Bailey, who is 17 years old, has long wavy hair, glasses, a heavy course load, and a raft of positions at the school newspaper, where she is the managing editor and news editor, as well as an entertainment columnist and a staff writer. Her bio posted on the paper’s website suggests that she is the kind of girl to put your money on. “With junior year testing my limits every waking moment, I am delighted to partake in my first year of journalism and relieve some of my stress through the pleasures of writing and editing,” she reports. “I joined journalism because I have a questionable obsession with the New York Times and am fascinated by the mechanics of creating a newspaper, which I get to experience by being part of the Bruin Voice staff.” One ticket out of Stockton, please.

Caitlin—this fact hits you with a hammer’s force, and there’s no point burying it—is a beautiful girl. She likes Napoleon Dynamite and The Ellen DeGeneres Show and the music of Blood on the Dance Floor. “I’m a lovey-dovey, old-school romantic,” Caitlin has said of herself, and also a bit of a pushover: “I won’t even say anything if people cut in front of me in line.”

Recently, Caitlin has been in a predicament that sparked Bailey’s attention and also her sympathy. In need of money, Caitlin began working in pornography, which has solved her short-term financial problems, but which has also led to people “saying things” about her at school. It occurred to the staff of the Bruin Voice that a story that treated Caitlin like any other inspirational student—one who had faced and overcome obstacles—a piece that allowed her to tell her side of the story, would be helpful to Caitlin and good for the paper.

Because Bailey had a class with Caitlin, she seemed the obvious choice to write it. She pitched the idea to the school newspaper’s faculty adviser, Katherine Duffel, who approved it, and soon the girl was working on a 1,000-word article about Caitlin. However, things quickly went sideways.

Read: Students who do sex work

The superintendent of the Lodi School District heard about the article, a mysterious turn of events, as there are almost 30,000 students in the busy and troubled district, and at that point only a handful of them knew about the article. The superintendent demanded to review it before publication, and Duffel refused. “It’s just the word pornography and where people’s minds go,” she told The New York Times. “I think they lose their minds, quite frankly, when they hear that word.”

At this point, an array of powerful adults sprang into action to ensure that the students at Caitlin’s school could know all about her work in porn, and how to find it. The Student Press Law Center referred Duffel and Bailey to an attorney named Matthew Cate, who took on the case pro bono.* Major news outlets, including the Times , covered the story in lavish detail, conveying a tone of moral neutrality toward the matter of a high-school girl making porn, and of quiet but obvious disapproval toward the infringement of the student journalists’ First Amendment rights. Cate read the article, assured the district that despite its concerns (among them, that students under 18 had viewed pornography in the preparation of the piece) it did not violate the state’s education code, and the article was published on May 3.

“Throughout their high school years, students are often told to follow their dreams and pursue what they love,” the piece begins, and it presents Caitlin as someone who is doing just that. The tone is that of a Seventeen feature circa 1964, the kind that told girls what it’s like to be a stewardess or a fashion model—here is something fun, and even glamorous, that any pretty girl, from any small town, can do if she puts her mind to it. “I travel to San Francisco a lot, and I don’t have to pay anything, because someone pays for the expenses,” Caitlin says. “I’ve been trying new things, going out of my comfort zone, and meeting new people.”

The uplifting tone belies much of the reported information about Caitlin. Apparently Caitlin—who later told media outlets that she is “estranged” from her family—moved out on New Year’s Eve and is now paying $300 a month in room and board to live at a friend’s house. It’s not clear whether she began doing porn before or after this event, but it’s clear that the work—in addition to a dishwashing job—helps her pay for the room and other expenses.

She has been “verified” on Pornhub, meaning that it’s possible for her to get paid for the videos she’s uploaded to the site, but at the time of the interview, her videos had not attracted enough views to earn her any money. One recent disappointment was being sent away from her first professional video shoot—arranged by her new “agent”—when the producers saw acne on her body and decided that they no longer wanted her.

So now that you have the facts of the case, here’s a question for you: What happened to us? When did we lose the ability to interpret the signs of a girl in bad trouble?

Feminists have wrestled with their relationship to pornography ever since the early ’70s, when the Rimbaud-loving Jersey girl Andrea Dworkin joined forces with America’s most lighthearted legal scholar, Catharine MacKinnon, and created sex-negative feminism. Their arguments about the nexus between violence against women and hard-core pornography were powerful, but the whole enterprise was a hard sell in the midst of the sexual revolution.

Catharine A. MacKinnon: Where #MeToo came from, and where it’s going

“No woman needs intercourse; few women escape it,” Dworkin said—what happened to Rimbaud?—from deep within her overalls, and she lost the crowd. MacKinnon’s legal argument depended on pornography’s potential violation of the equal-protection clause, a delicate proposition, and one she was advancing at a time when free speech was at the very center of the youth movement. The women were raising important questions, but in 1988 the World Wide Web arrived, blotting out the sun and giving us porn without end, porn as it is now and ever shall be, porn beamed down from the starry heavens into the world’s bedrooms and bathrooms, buses and fast-food joints, church parking lots and prison cells. Porn surrounding you in the room where you sit reading this article—all you have to do is set your phone to pick up the signal.

“Not half a dozen men have ever been able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their head,” Cecilia Brady tells us in The Last Tycoon, and the same is true of internet porn. When Christ arrived, there was plenty of warning (“Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended?”), but porn just crashed down, set its own terms, and left us on our own. It was a gyre that kept widening, and everything fell into it and disappeared, until porn was the truth and private behavior was the lie. The curtain stirring in the breeze fell into the gyre, and the missed class, and the hotel room. The shirttails tucked rapidly into chinos, the skirt quickly zippered fell into it. These things still existed, of course, but they were mediated by porn, as all sex was mediated by it—a performance of it, or a rejection of it, or an attempt to erase certain images from it.

Children learn about the mechanics of sex—or rather, that mechanics is the whole of sex—by watching women who may have been blood-tested and “verified” professionals, or who may have been so impoverished and desperate that they would have done literally anything for cash or drugs. Everyone is welcomed into this vast emporium of sex, and although the party line is that consumers bring their own desires to it and simply find the porn that suits them, the influence runs in the other direction.“If you’re with somebody for the first time,” a sex researcher at Indiana University helpfully tells her students, “don’t choke them, don’t ejaculate on their face, don’t try to have anal sex with them. These are all things that are just unlikely to go over well.”

Natasha Singh: Talk to your kids about porn

Certainly we can reserve judgment about private sexual behavior, but we can’t pretend that the things people expect to do in bed, or expect partners to do in bed, have not been hugely—almost entirely, by this point—influenced by online porn. No wonder so much sex between young people takes place behind a thick velvet curtain of alcohol—who wouldn’t want to be under anesthesia for some of these exercises? Culture is progressive and cumulative, and so is porn, restlessly seeking and crossing the next boundary, and thereby making whatever came before it seem tame and ordinary.

The problem is that there are some very old human impulses that must now contend with porn. One of them is the tendency of deeply troubled teenage girls to act out sexually as a kind of distress signal, an attempt to get the attention of adults who may not be getting the message that they’re in a crisis. Working this out within the closed world of a high school was painful, and almost always contributed to suffering, but it was something that could be transcended—eventually everyone moves on and the past settles into place.

But working out these impulses within the pitiless economy of the vast, global pornography industry is an entirely different proposition. Whenever a third party stands to profit from the sexual choices of a woman, a door is opened into another world, far beyond the high school, the disappointed parents, the town where she lives. It’s natural that this would become the venue for these troubled girls; porn is the main determinant of high-school kids’ sexual imaginings. Girls who feel uncomfortable or shamed about their body are deeply drawn to it. “I liked the attention I got,” Caitlin says of her first foray into selling pictures online; she liked “being called beautiful. I enjoyed it because it made me feel good about myself.”

The idea, vigorously maintained by a certain kind of young porn star and by her feminist defenders, is that it is entirely possible to be an adult performer yet in private life be someone who is perhaps modest, perhaps—as Caitlin describes herself—an “old-fashioned romantic.” It’s hard to imagine that it’s possible. I suppose the model for this might be marriage, in which a woman might be extremely modest and careful in her public dealings, but in bed with her husband is a fully sexual being, her desires as carnal and adventurous as anyone else’s. But it seems to me that a troubled teenager, desperate to be called beautiful, will have her sense of self deeply affected by work in that industry, which will quickly seek to put her in ever more extreme forms of on-camera behavior.

What has happened is that within a few years of porn’s arrival, the country quickly learned what it was dealing with—something it had no power to control, something it couldn’t even keep small children from encountering—and so modern life simply adjusted itself around the new, imperial leader. The left decided to champion porn in a variety of ways, beginning with reconceiving the women who work in it as fully liberated, empowered feminists, as though every woman you see in porn is driving carpool and making the weekly Costco run. Sure, there are women in porn who do those things. Do you know what percent of the vast, global porn industry these self-actualized porn workers represent? Not a large one.

The right understands porn as a thing for sale, and so has a grudging respect for it. “It’s Trump,” the porn star Eva Lovia told Fortune at the 2016 AVN Awards when she was asked whom she was supporting for president, “because I like my money. I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I want to keep it.” The right destroyed the one force capable of challenging porn’s ubiquity: social conservatism. It gleefully elected a sleazeball whose personal history is that of a man with contempt for the ideas of personal responsibility and duty to others that were once central to social conservatism.

The right sold out social conservatism for lower taxes and “The Snake.” Our shadow first lady, Stormy Daniels, enacts an endless performance of Fatal Attraction; Donald Trump calls her “Horseface” on Twitter, and her own sleazeball lawyer—who was somehow briefly considered a potential Democratic candidate for president—is currently out on $300,000 bail in a serious extortion case. The president calls a much-loved, exceedingly minor member of the British royal family “nasty,” and his own beautiful daughter “Baby”—and there isn’t anything left of the social conservatism of yesteryear but money, and selling any valuable commodity we have remaining, from our natural resources to our international reputation to our young girls.

The only person questioning any of these notions seems to be Caitlin herself, who labors under the delusion that she’s not living on a darkling plain. “The only hard thing so far is making sure I have enough money,” she told Bailey, in the testing, hopeful way of a teenager trying to wheedle something out of adults. Maybe she had gained—from Napoleon Dynamite and Ellen—the impression that she lives in a society where the center holds, and where promising girls are not left to drift so far beyond the shoreline that no one feels impelled to consider a rescue. “Other than that”—here she is, the daughter that you and I made together, letting us know how she’s doing—“I’ve honestly been doing really good with myself.”

## The Flaw at the Center of Purity Culture

The summer before my sophomore year of high school, I dedicated my life to Jesus and became a Christian. As one of the few Asians at my school, outside Atlanta, I found refuge in local Korean churches, where I met like-minded friends.

Week by week, our hangouts after church became less about finding comfort in our Korean American selves and more about finding our identity in Christ. A big part of forming a Christian identity when I was young was about waiting to have sex until marriage. If we overcame our fleshly desires and transcended the needs of the physical body, we were told, we would have more time and space for receiving God’s grace and sanctification.

Our unnies and oppas taught us that a vow of chastity would keep us from getting hurt or becoming damaged, like protecting a delicate flower from blooming too early. If my flower became spoiled, then putting it back together would be really hard. If I faltered, I also risked not having intimacy with God and living the perfect, sanctified life. I read this passage from Romans 12 over and over: “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God—what is good and acceptable and perfect.”

I’ve been thinking about my upbringing in the church a lot this week, after the killing of Asian American women near where I grew up. The shooter, who was active in an evangelical church, said that he had a “sex addiction,” an assertion many in the evangelical world recognize as an outgrowth of purity culture gone awry. The details of his case are still being investigated, but as I mourned with other Asian American Christian women, I was reminded how harmful purity culture is for girls and women.

When I was a teenager, I was convinced that if I followed all the rules of purity, I would have a good relationship with God and naturally attract great godly men, and eventually a great godly husband. Many of my church friends decided to take a break from their boyfriend for up to a year to work on their relationship with God, and many decided that they would not even touch their boyfriend until they were married, to avoid temptation.

I read many books to help me remain sexually pure, most notably Elisabeth Elliot’s Passion and Purity and Joshua Harris’s I Kissed Dating Goodbye. For me, though, one book shone above the rest: Jackie Kendall and Debby Jones’s Lady in Waiting. It was the ultimate guide to becoming a pure woman in order to achieve holiness and attract the right kind of man. I read and reread this book, using different highlighters and making notes in multiple colors. The pages of my book became tattered and torn, and the binding became unglued. I didn’t mind that the writing was a bit cheesy—I wanted to attract a man like Ruth’s Boaz in the Old Testament. Boaz was a tenderhearted man who saved Ruth and her mother-in-law from poverty and rejection. Lady in Waiting instructed me to love God with reckless abandon in order to attract my own Boaz, and not a “Bozo.” My sexual purity was the ultimate turn-on for a godly man. I vowed to stay on track. I felt closer to God already.

The rules didn’t seem to apply equally to everyone, however, which I noticed as I began working at and attending primarily white or multicultural churches in college and as I grew older. For all this talk about transcending your body to be pure, I sure was being evaluated on mine. One woman stroked my hair without hesitation while cooing, “Your hair is so beautiful and just so Asian.” I gritted my teeth when men pinched my cheeks after I played music at worship service. I pretended to be entertained when men started conversations with me by fumbling through their ni haos and an yong ha say yos. And I lost count of how many times I was called a China doll.

I was encouraged to give “side hugs,” because full-frontal hugs were very tempting to men, especially those who enjoyed meeting Asian women. I realized that I was sometimes perceived as an exotic temptress rather than a China doll. And although I didn’t quite understand why this happened, I felt ashamed of what I assumed was a character flaw. I repented after every physical interaction with a man that crossed the strict boundaries laid out in my books and by my pastors. I confessed to my unnies and oppas, sobbing, while they encouraged me to keep “running the race,” that it was never too late to become a godly woman. I read Lady in Waiting again and was reminded that even Rahab the prostitute was shown God’s grace, because she gave birth to Boaz.

I heard the whispers about other women around me who had had secret abortions. Some felt too ashamed or judged to return to church, even as their exes and violators continued to rise in leadership. Stories came out about guys who were having sex, cheating on their girlfriends multiple times, and abusing women. Church leaders told us that no man is perfect, and that they’d grow out of their southern “drinkin’ and carousin’.” If they were called by God, we had to show them grace and forgiveness.

In the book of Revelation, a beautiful character named the “woman clothed with the sun” wears a crown of stars, with the moon at her feet, and she is enveloped in God’s light before giving birth. Another character, the “great whore,” is clothed in purple and scarlet, and wears massive amounts of jewelry. She holds a cup full of her impurities, and has “Babylon the great, mother of whores and of earth’s abominations” branded on her forehead. When John the Revelator sees this woman, he says something I now find chilling and telling: I was greatly amazed.

He is smitten with her as he stares at her drunken body, covered in jewels. Eventually, an angel yells some sense into him, revealing that this woman represents the people and institutions that turned on Jesus. She is stripped naked by beasts that “devour her flesh and burn her up with fire.”

These two characters represent a familiar binary for many evangelical women. We are either temptresses or radiant queens. In my case, as an Asian American woman, this binary exists on several levels beyond the Christian one. Asian bodies are, as the writer Anne Anlin Cheng has noted, ornamental because they’re oriental. Exotic and mysterious. Small and submissive. China dolls or dragon ladies. Lotus flowers or tiger moms.

As I followed my calling into the evangelical ministry world, I felt vulnerable in the midst of powerful white male domination. I blamed myself for feeling uneasy when a Christian social-justice leader planted a wet kiss on my cheek and held on to me while saying I was the Asian American voice of racial reconciliation. I blamed myself when another worship leader sent me pictures of his penis. In every uncomfortable situation, I figured that I was the common denominator—the great whore—and I absorbed the shame of feeling impure and far from God.

Not once did I consider whether exotification, misogyny, or Asian fetishization had anything to do with my shame. Not once did I consider that these dynamics play into layers of heteronormative patriarchy, male domination, and the subjugation of women. Not once did I consider that the men behaved inappropriately because they assumed that I would not say anything. Not once did I consider that they were wrong. I only thought about how I was somehow at fault. The hours spent poring over my manual, Lady in Waiting, seemed to have been for nothing, as I failed miserably in my pursuit of holiness and sanctification. In my worst moments, I wondered if I would ever get back to God.

A moment of disillusionment finally came one night during dinner with a friend who was in town for a conference. She confided in me that a Christian leader we both knew had inappropriately touched her. I was shocked. I told her that I had also had an incident with him. After hearing her story, I realized that I wasn’t at fault when men harassed me. And I began to understand that the lie of transcendent purity enabled an entire system of everyday sexist abuse.

Around this time, I had taken a job at the Chicago campus of Willow Creek Community Church, an evangelical megachurch led by Bill Hybels. A few years later, Hybels was accused of sexual misconduct, allegations that eventually led him to step down. (Hybels denies the accusations.) Triggered by the scandal, several women told me stories about other church leaders in their past who’d harmed them in some way. The shame and abuse in the wider Christian world was more extensive than I had imagined, and now I was holding their stories as well as my own.

I had had enough. I had already submitted my resignation, because I had decided to go back to divinity school for my master’s, but I moved up my end date and left the institution and culture that had made so many women suffer in isolation and silence.

I eventually learned to embrace different ways of interpreting the Bible that considered and centered the viewpoint of women. I focused on Ruth’s loyalty and solidarity with her mother-in-law. I wondered if John the Revelator was misogynistic in his choice to classify women as objects of purity or destruction, and learned how to contrast him with Jesus, who valued all sorts of complicated women in his life and ministry. I sought out churches that let women minister and lead without depending on male models of leadership, and I called out injustices when I saw them, by trusting my God-given body and believing what it felt, instead of trying to transcend it to escape ugly realities.

When I recently gathered on Zoom with Asian American female leaders in the Christian world to mourn the deaths of the women in Atlanta, I felt soothed as they sang the songs of our ancestors and prayed. I am thankful that the #MeToo movement prompted #ChurchToo and a whole new canon of resources for Christian women seeking to flourish outside the harmful effects of purity culture. By disentangling myself from the ideals of purity, I am creating new ways of being with others in my community. I feel much closer to God already.

## Modern Porn Education Is Totally Unprepared for Modern Porn

Earlier this year, Manhattan’s prestigious Dalton School bid farewell to Justine Ang Fonte, its then-director of health and wellness, who had guided the academy’s sex education for years. Their parting was the conclusion of a minor media scandal with all the makings of a major one: Fonte, who also gives presentations at other institutions, had become the subject of controversy after offering a frank porn-literacy course to high schoolers at Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School in May, resulting in a scandalized write-up in the New York Post. A handful of Columbia Prep parents were, it seemed, appalled by the allegedly explicit presentation Fonte had given their children.

Fonte was taken aback. In her nine years of teaching porn-literacy courses, she had always felt that her work was well received. Exposure to porn is an almost-guaranteed fact of adolescent life thanks to the rise of smart devices and the ubiquity of the internet—and yet, Fonte told me, some parents “may not be ready for the actual truth as to their role in addressing it, and the reality of what their child is actually seeing.”

“It’s not a Playboy magazine anymore,” Fonte said, citing familiar but no less crucial facts about the kind of explicit material available to kids today. “It’s bodies in motion—amplifying certain beauty standards that are harmful; amplifying lack of protection in certain cases, void of emotional intimacy; and, because race is a genre, amplifying racist sexual violence.” Her goal, she said, is always to give teenagers the tools to “navigate their personal and social spaces through these three adjectives: Their world should be safe, should be fulfilling, should be pleasurable.” Mainstream porn can work against that tripartite goal, Fonte said; other forms, such as feminist-inflected porn sold at prices intended to supply decent wages, may support it.

What seemed lost on the outraged parents of Columbia Prep was that their kids weren’t so much titillated by Fonte’s presentation as annoyed and bored: “Everyone was texting each other, ‘What the hell is this? It’s so stupid.’ Everyone knows about porn,” one student told the Post. Why skip an Advanced Placement class or two, with a test on the horizon, just to hear a spiel about porn, consent, and gender that any self-respecting scion of the upper class could likely recite from memory? And, perhaps closer to consternated parents’ concerns, why spend the proceeds of their hefty tuition checks on woke proselytizing about gender, sexuality, race, and the rest, when porn is more of a vice to be contained than a habit to be cultivated?

But dismissing porn literacy as progressive evangelizing suggests an enormous misapprehension of the problem itself. Many digital natives who pride themselves on a certain kind of ennui likely far underestimate exactly how difficult it is to be an ethical user of pornography, or even to begin to judge how to be such a person, given the dark, circuitous routes porn travels before it arrives as a thumbnail on a streaming site. And parents who imagine porn-literacy courses like Fonte’s to be little more than crash courses in en vogue libertinism seem entirely unaware of how dire the stakes are. The risk isn’t that their children may be exposed to something “dirty” or politically incorrect, but that their children may well be exposed to things that are brutal, cruel, vicious, even genuinely criminal—the sort of material law-enforcement agents carefully train themselves to encounter—all without a sense of how to distinguish the authentically violent from that which only masquerades as such. If anything, courses like Fonte’s aren’t given nearly enough funding, time, or other resources to fully demonstrate just how onerous ethical porn use really is. Without that kind of guidance, how are teenagers supposed to have any idea how to be good people in the world we’ve created?

How are any of us, for that matter?

Consider the case of Pornhub, a cheerfully mainstream porn-streaming platform that averaged 115 million visits per day in 2019, then boosted its traffic further by offering its premium services free of charge during the pandemic.

Victims’ advocates have long argued that the website, which received almost 7 million new video uploads in 2019, allows users to share content depicting actual sex crimes in progress—including child pornography, material made or stolen without victims’ knowledge, and recordings of sexual assaults. In December, the journalist Nicholas Kristof brought those concerns to national attention with a startling exposé in The New York Times. In February, the Canadian House of Commons published transcripts of its evidentiary hearings on what, exactly, Pornhub had offered its millions of monthly visitors.

One woman told the House’s Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics that she had found a video that her abusive ex-husband had made in which she was sexually violated while asleep or unconscious, possibly drugged. Another woman recounted that when she was 15, she was extorted into sending videos and images of herself to a man online, who uploaded the material to Pornhub. The man “made me send videos of vaginal and anal masturbation, videos of me removing my clothes, videos of me spitting on myself and more,” she said. “The videos that made me quit contact was when they went on to ask me to eat my own feces and drink my own urine.” The site has also served as a clearinghouse for actual stolen hidden-camera footage—video of female athletes in a South Carolina college locker room, for instance—and revenge porn, meaning explicit photos or videos created in the context of an intimate relationship and later released to humiliate an ex-partner.

Thus any or none of the videos on Pornhub titled, as one activist read to Parliament, “Innocent Teenage Girls Are Used and Exploited”; “Crying Teen”; “Passed Out Teen”; “Very Young South American”; “Junior High School Student”; “Anal Crying Teen”; and “I’m 14” could be authentic. If parents imagine that they have nothing more to worry about than their teenagers coming across explicit material—or a too-liberal curriculum aimed at helping them process the stuff—then they’ve hugely underestimated the task before them. Ideally, any web user in regular contact with explicit content could have some sense of what to do when met with material that ought to be brought to the attention of authorities. But that would require much more guidance than adolescents—let alone adults—are given now.

After all, distinguishing between images or videos carefully tailored to appear genuine and those that indeed are is a hard task even for the law-enforcement agents trained in investigating these kinds of sex crimes.

Sonja Nordstrom, a retired FBI special agent of 23 years, has seen more of these horrors than most. She began investigating images of child sexual abuse shared online in the 1990s, when the virtual spread of such material was still new. Her job required her to personally analyze “thousands upon thousands of terabytes” of potentially criminal pornographic material. The images that she and her colleagues analyzed and compiled would then be checked against databases of images already known to law enforcement. If novel images surfaced, Nordstrom told me, investigators “would also be in a position to verify with certainty, This is in fact a child, right? Because it’s not always easy to tell.”

Nor is it necessarily clear when ostensibly adult, consensual, paywalled content is something else altogether. Last month, federal prosecutors for the Southern District of California announced that Ruben Andre Garcia, a porn actor, recruiter, producer, fraudster, and sex trafficker, had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the GirlsDoPorn and GirlsDoToys franchises, each of which had posted clips to Pornhub. Garcia, the release stated, had been in the business of tricking women into signing up for clothed modeling gigs, then coercing them—often with the help of paid female shills, drugs, alcohol, and threats of force—into participating in porn shoots with false assurances that the results would never be posted online. One woman, who was 19 when she appeared in a GirlsDoPorn segment, reported that she had been given several rum-and-Cokes before her scene and was drunk during filming. Someone happening upon her video in pursuit of something barely legal would’ve been further from the mark than they could have known.

Likewise, commercially successful adult-film performers have alleged coercion and exploitation not unlike the predations of Hollywood’s Harvey Weinstein, save that for many of them their sexual abuse is the product itself. In a candid podcast episode that aired earlier this year, the actor Lana Rhoades recounted a scene in which she had been gagged by a male performer until she vomited into a bowl, which he then urinated in and commanded Rhoades to drink from. “I didn’t know how to say no,” Rhoades said. “I could be dying inside doing something, but I would have a smile on my face and say, ‘Thank you for the work, everyone.’” A contract may have been signed, but the cruelty and degradation were unsimulated.

Rhoades has since said that she would destroy the videos she made while working in the adult-film industry if she could. “If I could go back, I would give up everything to have my dignity and respect back, and for people not to be able to see me in that way,” she said during a recent podcast interview. But Rhoades doesn’t own the rights to all of her work, and even if she did, that likely wouldn’t matter.

“If you look at the volume of material that goes in and out of social-media sites or hub sites or whatever, it could be on there for five minutes, and it is forever captured and now available somewhere else, even if you were to take it down,” Nordstrom told me. Content that’s only very briefly or very closely shared can instantly blend into the warp and weft of the internet. At that point, extricating the material becomes all but impossible.

Minor victims identified by law enforcement have a right to receive notice, Nordstrom told me, anytime a new cache of child pornography is recovered that includes their image. “Sometimes,” she said, “they get inundated with so many letters, they just say, ‘Don’t even tell me anymore.’” When something terrible happens to someone as a child or an adult, conscious or unconscious, in whatever stage of coercion or desperation—it has happened to them for the rest of their lives. When it’s recorded and promulgated as entertainment, it is happening to them, over and over again, just the same. And that wouldn’t be possible without an audience.

When Nordstrom began her work, photos and videos that had been shared among a select group of criminals via U.S. mail were just emerging on the fledgling web. Now, she says, material that was once risky and challenging to access disseminates so quickly and so permanently that “it’s almost hard to escape.” The same seems true of porn overall, which has those ambiguous, dark reaches woven in. Given the ubiquity of porn online and in our culture at large, a reasonable person might wonder whether teenagers would be much interested in trying to grapple with the ethics of it, and their obligations as consumers.

And the same person might be surprised by the answer. On a July weekend, I sat down with four teenagers—three girls and one boy, ranging in age from 16 to 18—to talk about their reflections on pornography and the way it has influenced their lives so far. None of them was especially enthusiastic about the genre, largely because they were enthusiastic about sex. (I agreed not to use their real names so that they could speak candidly about this sensitive topic.)

“The boys that I have had sex with,” Thalia, 17, told me, “I can tell while having sex with them which one’s watched too much porn, based on how they behave during sex.” It comes across as a certain impersonal performance, she said, “or they’ll do certain things that … I know they probably wouldn’t have thought of organically.”

I asked about the nature of those learned behaviors. Were they violent, disconcerting, uncomfortable?

“When I first started having sex, I thought that I was just—because of watching porn and also listening to other people my age talk about sex, the weird ubiquity of BDSM culture—I thought that I was just supposed to like being, like, choked and stuff,” Thalia said.

Joy, 18, agreed: “I think there was a point in my life where I tried to convince myself that I could possibly be into that. And now that I have grown up, I’m like, ‘No way, I would never let anyone do that to me.’”

“Personally I have only had sex with one person,” Callie, 18, added. “And he is not even as exposed to porn as I would think that most boys are, and he thought that [choking] was a normal thing.”

Thalia mused that the light, obligatory strangling had become vanilla among a certain set of her peers. “It’s taken on a weird flavor, maybe, where it’s like—who can have the most weird, violent sex? It’s like a contest.”

She herself found the violent turn, both online and in real life, quite disturbing. “You see some fucked-up stuff,” Thalia said about scrolling through sites such as Pornhub. “People looking like they’re in pain … people pretending to be raped.” Those scenes had stayed with her, though she hadn’t sought out porn in some time. In fact, none of the girls had.

But more surprising to me was the fact that Arthur, 16, had chosen to regulate his porn use too.

During the pandemic shutdowns, Arthur had spent more time than usual viewing porn. But there came a point when he realized that the ordinary, commercial-grade stuff featured on the front pages of popular streaming sites wasn’t cutting it anymore. His tastes were changing—for the worse.

“I feel like, when you watch more of it,” he said, “that’s when you start getting the more specific stuff; you know what I mean? Because it’s like, when you eat a bunch of pizza, pizza don’t hit the same … If you open up a homepage, and you’re not Wow, then you should just get off. You should wait for a different time.”

It wasn’t that he couldn’t have found material that was more novel, more extreme, more titillating. At 16, Arthur already knows that the internet is awash with every sort of sexual content you can imagine, and some you likely—hopefully—can’t. It was that he had the foresight to realize that the search for novel extremes can be bottomless, and he had no desire to peer into that void.

“I was like, ‘Fuck this,’” he told me, “and I started spacing out” time spent with porn. “It works.”

Since the Canadian House of Commons’ investigation, more than 30 women have sued Pornhub’s parent company for profiting off videos of their sexual exploitation, and the website has hastily tidied up its offerings—though when I asked Nordstrom how much good that would do, she wasn’t optimistic. “I think it requires an inherent societal change, a behavioral change where society says, ‘This is important to us,’” she said. “There is no way to regulate” our way out of this mire.

On that count, Fonte seems to agree. The adolescents who consume free porn from streaming sites aren’t “thinking about the politics behind it, the economics behind it, and certainly not the ethics behind it,” she said, because they’re too often concerned with very elementary questions they lack answers to: Are their bodies normal? Should they look a certain way? Is this what sex is supposed to be like? With more leeway for comprehensive sex education, Fonte told me, she would raise the question of “Who is on the other side of the screen that you’re benefiting from?”

People will have to determine for themselves that the answer to that question matters; that the expenditure of resources on education, for prevention, and law enforcement, for prosecution is worth it; and that they don’t want to be the sort of individuals who enjoy artifacts of others’ suffering, inconvenient as that might be. It’s the kind of decision Arthur has already made; the only shame is that he had to make it on his own.

## The Cult of Virginity Just Won’t Let Go

In the Middle Ages, a royal bride would be inspected before her wedding night to make sure she was a virgo intacta—a virgin with an intact hymen covering the entrance to her vagina. “The Hymen is a membrane not altogether without blood,” wrote the 17th-century court obstetrician Louise Bourgeois. “In the middle it hath a little hole, through which the menses are voided. This at the first time of copulation is broken, which causes some pain, and gushing forth of some quantity of blood; which is an evident sign of virginity.”

In reality, some girls are born without a hymen, while others tear the membrane long before they have sex, most commonly by exercising or, today, by using tampons. Yet the demand for virginity testing—typically, a gynecological exam in which a doctor looks for the presence of a hymen—has proved surprisingly durable. In 1979, the British government performed one on a 35-year-old Indian woman who had traveled to London to get married, in order “to see whether she was, in fact, a bona fide virgin.” (The Guardian later revealed that immigration officials subjected more than 80 women to such tests from 1976 to 1979.) The Egyptian authorities used the pretext of virginity inspections to assault female protesters during the Arab Spring in 2011, and until July of this year the Indonesian military regularly performed such assessments not only on female recruits, but also on the fiancées of its male soldiers.

Today, the practice persists among some Muslims in Europe, Asia, and Africa; the Roma in Europe; and some Orthodox Jewish and Christian-fundamentalist communities in the United States. Two years ago, the American rapper T.I. claimed that he took his daughter for “yearly trips to the gynecologist to check her hymen. Yes, I go with her … I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.” He later said that the story had been sensationalized, that he had never been in the room when the examination happened, and that “there was never any objection” from her. His daughter Deyjah Harris, however, said that she felt she “couldn’t say no.”

This fall, Britain is poised to ban virginity tests—and will consider banning hymen-repair surgery too. That would be an impressive victory, because in an era that prioritizes novel and sensational issues, feminists find it hard to sustain interest in slow, incremental campaigns against harmful traditions. (Many people assume a practice that sounds this medieval must have been abolished by now.) A further complication is that virginity testing and hymen-repair surgery are practiced largely by members of religious and ethnic minorities, which makes many liberals nervous about criticizing those who demand the procedures. Women’s-rights advocates have also had to counter an insidious kind of political spin. Practitioners of virginity testing and hymen-repair surgery have tried to rebrand them in a neutral or even positive way: Many doctors’ websites present these procedures not as outdated patriarchal methods of enforcing purity, but as empowering—rejuvenating forms of self-care, like plumping your lips or getting a face-lift.

Virginity tests are not just degrading—they are also useless. The World Health Organization is clear: “There is no scientific merit to, or clinical indication for ‘virginity testing’ or to a ‘virginity examination.’” In addition to hymen inspections, the other main method is the “two-finger test” to check the tightness of the vagina. These tests are much more invasive, but equally pointless.

That’s why the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government recently committed to making virginity tests illegal. Richard Holden, a young Conservative member of Parliament, has proposed an amendment criminalizing the practice in a bill likely to pass sometime this autumn. Holden heard about the issue on a youth-oriented radio show, and took it on because he was so surprised that such testing was still legal. (“When I spoke to colleagues, it hadn’t hit people’s radars,” he told me.) He found 21 clinics offering the procedure in the United Kingdom, charging up to £300 ($410) for a virginity certificate. In the United States, meanwhile, a 2016 survey of 300 gynecologists found that 10.1 percent had had at least one patient request a virginity test in the previous 12 months, and 3.5 percent had performed such a test.

The participation of doctors gives the procedure a veneer of legitimacy. Families would once demand to see blood-stained sheets the morning after a wedding, or send a girl to a midwife for a two-finger test, Diana Nammi, the founder of the London-based Iranian and Kurdish Women’s Rights Organization (IKWRO), told me, but now “they modernize it, sending a woman before the wedding night to a clinic.” (Over Zoom, she dropped heavy air quotes around the word modernize.) Aneeta Prem, the founder of the women’s-rights group Freedom Charity, told me that virginity testing has become part of a “package” demanded by families in arranged marriages: “It isn’t just the photograph, it isn’t just the education [or that] she can cook this or that dish. But also she’s a virgin and here’s the proof.”

Though the British government appears poised to prohibit virginity testing, its response to Holden’s proposal to ban so-called virginity-repair surgery as well has been more lukewarm. Like virginity testing, hymenoplasty is pure pseudoscience: A 2012 study by Dutch researchers found that 17 out of 19 women who’d had the surgery still did not bleed on their wedding night. Sometimes, there are no remnants of a hymen left to reconstruct, so surgeons instead create an artificial one using skin from the vaginal wall. Hymenoplasty, Holden told me, is a form of female genital mutilation. “This is a fraudulent medical practice,” he said. “We wouldn’t let people say there are elves living in their hair. If there’s no medical validity for it, why the hell are we allowing it?”

And yet cosmetic surgeries are difficult to ban if demand exists for them. Hymenoplasty is a widely advertised procedure in North America and Europe, usually performed as outpatient surgery under local or general anesthesia at a cost of about $4,000. It is carried out by more than a dozen clinics on London’s Harley Street, the traditional home of British medicine, as well as by surgeons across the United States and Canada.

Doctors who advertise the procedure—or defend carrying it out—use the faux-feminist language of choice and empowerment. “By providing this service,” one doctor in Britain told Sky News this summer, “we open the door to women who want to seek this treatment and give them options. It is not up to me or the government, the option is there.” Two years ago, a New York doctor who performs hymenoplasties—including on girls under 18 with parental consent—told an interviewer that his office was a “safe space” for girls and women.

Yet many of the women asking for hymenoplasty do so because they fear for their life. In 2002, 16-year-old Heshu Jones, from the Kurdish community of West London, was murdered by her father after allegedly failing a virginity test. Her father slit her throat and then jumped off a balcony in an attempt to kill himself. He then claimed that al-Qaeda members had broken into their flat before finally admitting the crime. The murder was the first to be recognized as an “honor killing” in Britain.

Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Aneeta Prem has seen a 40 percent increase in calls to the Freedom Charity hotline, as school and business shutdowns have made other sources of emotional support inaccessible. Some of those women call to ask for help raising the money for surgery. “One girl asked us to pay for hymenoplasty for her,” she said. “It was £3,000.” When Prem refused, the girl told her that she would have to become a prostitute to raise the money, because her fiance’s family would kill her if they discovered that she was not a virgin. “I know girls that have said on their wedding night they will take fake blood, or take a razor into bed with them, just to bleed somewhere.” (After an outcry in India over “artificial-hymen pills” for sale on Amazon, the company withdrew them from sale in some countries. However, third-party sellers still list “hymen kits” containing fake-blood capsules on the U.S. site.) Though she was sympathetic to the girl’s situation, Prem believes that only a ban can curb the obsession with virginity that drives honor-based violence.

Opponents of virginity testing and virginity repair in the U.K. face two obstacles. The first is the fear that any ban will drive the practice underground—or, more likely, abroad. That’s why women’s-rights advocates want the legislation to be written to criminalize taking a girl overseas for surgery. Rather than tolerate the procedure on British soil, Diana Nammi from IKWRO is adamant that the only answer is to destroy the cult of virginity. “We have to delete it, to make it history,” she told me. Her organization sees virginity testing as part of a wider cultural fixation on “honor.”

The campaigns manager at IKWRO is 33-year-old Payzee Mahmod, whose sister Banaz was killed in London on the orders of her family because she left her abusive, forced marriage. (Mahmod’s father and uncle were convicted of the murder in 2007, along with three other men.) Growing up in Iran, Mahmod told me, she was warned not to play roughly, or ride a bicycle, or even sit the wrong way in case she accidentally tore her hymen, “this thing that was to be really, really protected.” She now campaigns against child marriage and forced marriage, as well as honor killings and virginity testing.

The second obstacle is the liberal fear of giving ammunition to racists and xenophobes who opportunistically comment on forced marriage, female genital mutilation, and other practices to bolster a narrative of white, Western supremacy. Grassroots campaigners have little time for such squeamishness. “This is violence against women,” Nammi said. “It shouldn’t be respected or tolerated. It is a crime.” She notes that the practice is not confined to Muslim communities, but is also carried out by some Jews and Christians. Richard Holden knows that some people will question a white conservative man championing the rights of women in minority communities, but he is unfazed. “There are fears of cultural sensitivities, and 25 years ago, things were different,” he said. “What it took was a generation of young female activists from those communities … to be a different voice.”

Virginity testing has no place in the modern world. It is a form of violence that normalizes further violence against women by upholding the idea that sexual behavior is a matter of family reputation or public debate. Virginity-repair surgery is a form of violence too. Surgeons should not be able to buy speedboats and fancy cars on the profits of a quack procedure with no medical benefits. There is nothing prejudiced about opposing both practices. The time to ban them is long overdue.

## Inside an OnlyFans empire: Sex, influence and the new American Dream

Inside an OnlyFans empire: Sex, influence and the new American Dream The fast-growing platform represents the creator economy at its most bluntly transactional, where sex is just another unit of content to monetize.

SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA — In the mornings, the workers of Bryce Adams’s OnlyFans empire buzz in through a camera-wired security gate, roll up the winding driveway that cost $120,000 to pave and park outside Adams’s $2.5 million home-office-studio complex. A large American flag waves from a pole above their office door. So does a banner depicting Adams, in tight shorts, from behind.

On OnlyFans, subscribers pay for monthly access to feeds of creators’ videos — many of them sex videos, known as “collabs” — as well as pay-to-watch clips the “fans” can buy a la carte. And as one of the platform’s most popular creators, Adams runs her business like a machine.

Inside, a storyboard designer opens the day’s publishing plans for not just OnlyFans but all of their customer feeder sites — Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube. Editors start splicing video into short looping clips, optimized for virality. Collabs are sent to paying fans.

Brian Adam, Bryce’s longtime boyfriend (who, like Bryce, uses a stage name for privacy), stops at each employee’s desk to review the day’s assignments, vetoing any posts or captions that seem “cringe” or “off brand.” In an office loft, four young women start texting with Adams’s paid subscribers, who talk about sex and their personal lives in conversations that often exceed a thousand messages a day.

This being a sex business, their workdays are filled with what others might see as debauchery, but which they see as just work: Two (or three) people will slip into a bedroom next to the kitchen or the gym with a cameraman, or just their cellphones, to record a collab or start live-streaming themselves exercising in the nude.

Then they’ll head back to their desks to resume chatting or drive to the beach to make TikToks. After a few days, the video editors will upload the files to the OnlyFans servers with names like “Bryce & Holly Shower” or “Sex on a Jungle Trail,” retailing for $25 a scene.

Adams’s employees call their headquarters in central Florida “the farm.” Bought last year with OnlyFans money, the 10 acres of pastureland once held a grove of pecan trees.

The team flies a flag showing what they call her “signature pose.” Her team recorded her lying in fresh concrete for a TikTok video, next to her employees' handprints.

Its only cash crop now is attention, and Adams’s business out-earns most American farms. The company brings in roughly $10 million annually in revenue, and many of her two dozen workers get paid more than the average farmer; her total corporate payroll exceeds $1 million a year.

“People don’t understand the scale of the opportunity. I mean, really: You can make your own world,” said Adams, 30, as she walked the grounds in jean shorts and a tank top. “This is our business. This is our life.”

In the American creator economy, no platform is quite as direct or effective as OnlyFans. Since launching in 2016, the subscription site known primarily for its explicit videos has become one of the most methodical, cash-rich and least known layers of the online-influencer industry, touching every social platform and, for some creators, unlocking a once-unimaginable level of wealth.

More than 3 million creators now post around the world on OnlyFans, which has 230 million subscribing “fans” — a global audience two-thirds the size of the United States itself, a company filing in August said.

And with help from a pandemic that isolated people at home, fans’ total payouts to creators soared last year to $5.5 billion — more than every online influencer in the United States earned from advertisers that year, according to an analysis into the creator economy this spring by Goldman Sachs Research.

If OnlyFans’s creator earnings were taken as a whole, the company would rank around No. 90 on Forbes’s list of the biggest private companies in America by revenue, ahead of Twitter (now called X), Neiman Marcus Group, New Balance, Hard Rock International and Hallmark Cards.

On the surface, OnlyFans is a simple business: Fans (mostly men) pay to scroll through feeds of photos and videos (mostly of women), with a few perks offered at additional cost, like direct chats with the creator or custom-made videos by fan request. Most, though not all, of its content is risqué, or “spicy,” and company executives joke that they are often misconstrued as “sexy Facebook.”

But as OnlyFans’s pool of influencers has grown, it has also professionalized. Many creators now operate like independent media companies, with support staffs, growth strategies and promotional budgets, and work to apply the cold quantification and data analytics of online marketing to the creation of a fantasy life.

The subscription site has often been laughed off as a tabloid punchline, a bawdy corner of the internet where young, underpaid women (teachers, nurses, cops) sell nude photos, get found out and lose their jobs.

But OnlyFans increasingly has become the model for how a new generation of online creators gets paid. Influencers popular on mainstream sites use it to capitalize on the audiences they’ve spent years building. And OnlyFans creators have turned going viral on the big social networks into a marketing strategy, using Facebook, Twitter and TikTok as sales funnels for getting new viewers to subscribe.

America’s social media giants for years have held up online virality as the ultimate goal, doling out measurements of followers, reactions and hearts with an unspoken promise: that internet love can translate into sponsorships and endorsement deals. But OnlyFans represents the creator economy at its most blatantly transactional — a place where viewers pay upfront for creators’ labor, and intimacy is just another unit of content to monetize.

The fast ascent of OnlyFans further spotlights how the internet has helped foster a new style of modern gig work that creators see as safe, remote and self-directed, said Pani Farvid, an associate professor and the director of the SexTech Lab at the New School, a New York-based university, who has made interviews with digital sex workers a major topic of her research.

Creators’ nonchalance about the digital sex trade has fueled a broader debate about whether the site’s promotion of feminist autonomy is a facade: just a new class of techno-capitalism, selling the same patriarchal dream. And even some OnlyFans veterans have urged aspiring creators to understand what they’re getting into: pressures to perform for a global audience; an internet that never forgets. “There is simply no room for naivety,” one said in a guide posted to Reddit’s r/CreatorsAdvice.

Farvid acknowledges that the job can be financially precarious and mentally taxing, demanding not just the technical labor of recording, editing, managing and marketing but also the physical and emotional labor of adopting a persona to keep clients feeling special and eager to spend.

But many creators, she added, still find it uniquely alluring — a rational choice in an often-irrational environment for gender, work and power. “Why would I spend my day doing dirty, degrading, minimum-wage labor when I can do something that brings more money in and that I have a lot more control over?” she recounted some telling her. “Does an accountant always enjoy their work? No. All work has pleasure and pain, and a lot of it is boring and annoying. Does that mean they’re being exploited?”

The attraction of financial freedom and the challenge of standing out have led many OnlyFans creators to run themselves like tech start-ups. Adams’s operation is registered in state business records as a limited liability company and offers quarterly employee performance reviews and catered lunch. It also runs with factory-like efficiency, thanks largely to a system designed in-house to track millions of data points on customers and content and ensure every video is rigorously planned and optimized.

The strategy is working: Adams and her employees, who spoke with The Washington Post on the condition that their real names and location be concealed and stage names be used to reduce the risk of harassment, have ascended to OnlyFans’s highest echelon of earners, which the platform calls its “top 0.01 percent.”

Since sending her first photo in 2021, Adams’s OnlyFans accounts have earned $16.5 million in sales, more than 1.4 million fans and more than 11 million “likes.” She now makes about $30,000 a day — more than most American small businesses — from subscriptions, video sales, messages and tips, half of which is pure profit.

Adams’s team sees its business as one of harmless, destigmatized gratification, in which both sides get what they want. The buyers are swiped over in dating apps, widowed, divorced or bored, eager to pay for the illusion of intimacy with an otherwise unattainable match. And the sellers see themselves as not all that different from the influencers they watched growing up on YouTube, charging for parts of their lives they’d otherwise share for free.

“This is normal for my generation, you know?” said Avery Leigh, the 20-year-old head of Adams’s advertising team, who made $150,000 in two months from her work with Adams and her own OnlyFans account. “I can go on TikTok right now and see ten girls wearing the bare minimum of clothing just to get people to join their page. Why not go the extra step to make money off it?”

The team poses for a photo in the gym at Adams's compound in August.

‘Cry in a Ferrari’

When Tim Stokely, a London-based operator of live-cam sex sites, founded OnlyFans with his brother in 2016, he framed it as a simple way to monetize the creators who were becoming the world’s new celebrities — the same online influencers, just with a payment button. In 2019, Stokely told Wired magazine that his site was like “a bolt-on to your existing social media,” in the same way “Uber is a bolt-on to your car.”

Since then, OnlyFans’s popularity has skyrocketed. In financial filings in the United Kingdom, where its owner, Fenix International Limited, is based, the company said its sales grew from $238 million in 2019 to more than $5.5 billion last year. Its international army of creators has also grown from 348,000 in 2019 to more than 3 million today — a tenfold increase. (And its leadership has made a fortune: The company paid its owner, the Ukrainian American venture capitalist Leonid Radvinsky, $338 million in dividends last year.)

The United States is OnlyFans’s biggest market, accounting for a large portion of its creator base and 70 percent of its annual revenue. The site has fans in 187 countries, the filings show, and a company executive said recently that it is targeting major “growth regions” in Latin America, Europe and Australia. (The Mexican diver Diego Balleza said he is using his $15-a-month account to save up for next year’s Paris Olympics.)

Before OnlyFans, pornography on the internet had been largely a top-down enterprise, with agents, producers, studios and other middlemen hoarding the profits of performers’ work. OnlyFans democratized that business model, letting the workers run the show: recording their own content, deciding their prices, selling it however they’d like and reaping the full reward.

The platform bans real-world prostitution, as well as extreme or illegal content, and requires everyone who shows up on camera to verify they’re 18 or older by sending in a video selfie showing them holding a government-issued ID. Beyond that, OnlyFans operates as a neutral marketplace, with no ads, trending topics or recommendation algorithms, placing few limitations on what creators can sell but also making it necessary for them to market themselves or fade away.

Many OnlyFans creators don’t offer anything explicit, and the site has pushed to spotlight its stable of chefs, comedians and mountain bikers on a streaming channel, OFTV. But erotic content on the platform is inescapable; even some outwardly conventional creators shed their clothes behind the paywall. The company plugs itself as the only social network that is “openly inclusive of all creator genres.”

OnlyFans creators are categorized as independent contractors of the platform, which offers basic tools for content publishing and customer acquisition and keeps 20 percent of creators’ revenue. OnlyFans sends 1099 forms to the IRS and all U.S. creators who earn more than $600 a year to confirm they are paying taxes on all income. (Adams said her business paid roughly $1.3 million in taxes last year.)

Enticed by the promise of wealth, an influx of new creators has begun paying for OnlyFans mentors and coaching programs that teach marketing strategies and techniques of the trade. For those overwhelmed by the logistics, agencies and account managers offer to handle administrative tasks, write captions and manage social accounts in exchange for a cut of the proceeds.

On Reddit’s r/onlyfansadvice, an unofficial “educational space” with more than 300,000 members, creators share tips on how to secure a bank loan with OnlyFans income, handle fan disputes or cope with dramatic swings in pay. “I took one week off social media and have never recovered,” one creator there recently said.

Like most platforms, OnlyFans suffers from a problem of incredible pay inequality, with the bulk of the profits concentrated in the bank accounts of the lucky few. In 2020, the independent researcher Tom Hollands scraped the website’s payment data and concluded that the top 1 percent of accounts made 33 percent of the money, and that most accounts took home less than $145 a month. (OnlyFans declined to provide its own analysis, and Hollands said the company has since made it harder to access this data or conduct new research.)

For those who do make it, however, the rewards can be life-changing. When the OnlyFans creator Elle Brooke was pushed during a TV interview in June to explain how a future child of hers might feel about her work, her response — “They can cry in a Ferrari” — became an OnlyFans rallying cry. Stella Sol, a dominatrix, tweeted, “It’s always so funny how mad people get at beautiful Women happily winning the game of life.”

‘Dream girlfriend’

Bryce and Brian first met 13 years ago in high school, in a class on career development, and the two were an instant match: driven, competitive, a little obsessive. He played baseball for eight hours a day, and she attended every practice and game, sitting in the bleachers with a logbook to record every ball and strike.

Adams had spent her teen years selling her old clothes on eBay and became thrilled by making imaginary money become real. So after she dropped out of college, the couple devoted themselves to a small internet business, buying baseball bats and gloves from local mom-and-pop shops and reselling them online. They hired their friends, and the company expanded until it became self-sustaining, and they got bored.

One Sunday night in January 2021, as the couple halfheartedly watched a movie on the couch, Adams created an OnlyFans account with a fake name and posted a photo of her butt. The couple had an open relationship; it was, she said, kind of a joke. Then a guy who found her account messaged her, and they started texting, and he asked for more. She had no clue how to price the photos, but the guy just kept paying. After two hours and five photos, she had made $62.

Her boyfriend saw a major business opportunity. Other creators’ OnlyFans accounts looked underproduced, he recalled, and the market of paying schmoes seemed limitless. “There is a huge demand, and the vendors’ ability to meet that demand is awful,” he said. “It’s like taking candy from babies.”

For Adams, the experience was also energizing. She could snap a selfie in two seconds and some stranger would give her cash. She felt wanted, maybe even a bit powerful. A few nights later, her boyfriend walked into the bathroom around 3 a.m. and Adams was sitting next to the bathtub, sexting.

“She was like, ‘I made $400 so far,’” he said. “And I was like, ‘That’s actually really cool.’ Then I peed and went back to bed.”

They began studying OnlyFans like a puzzle, tracking what fans wanted, what they’d pay to get it and what to say to keep them hooked. They started logging a collection of data, from video sell-through rates to subscriber conversions. And they conducted what they called “micro-tests” on everything in hopes of gaining maximum engagement: the most lucrative seductive poses, the perfectly sized video-title length.

Every week, they competed with themselves to beat last week’s revenue, gradually pushing the boundaries in hopes of standing out in a porn-filled internet. They moved from selling individual photos to “picture packs” to full videos. They started recording in new places, involving each other and bringing on new partners. And their fan count continued to grow.

Watching their partner have sex with someone else sometimes sparked what they called “classic little jealousy issues,” which Adams said they resolved with “more communication, more growing up.” The money was just too good. And over time, they adopted a self-affirming ideology that framed everything as just business. Things that were tough to do but got easier with practice, like shooting a sex scene, they called, in gym terms, “reps.” Things one may not want to do at first, but require some mental work to approach, became “self-limiting beliefs.”

As Adams’s popularity exploded, so, too, did the workload for her and Brian, who became her “chief executive”; each worked about 90 hours a week. There was always a new sext to respond to, a new piece of social content to publish, a new collab to record. In the evenings, the couple would take long walks, strategizing about content, how to “take Bryce up a level.” Afterward, they’d pick up Starbucks to have caffeine through the night.

They started hiring workers through friends and family, and what was once just Adams became a team effort, in which everyone was expected to workshop caption and video ideas. The group evaluated content under what Brian, who is 31, called a “triangulation method” that factored their comfort level with a piece of content alongside its engagement potential and “brand match.” Bryce the person gave way to Bryce the brand, a commercialized persona drafted by committee and refined for maximum marketability.

“One of the things we do communicate is: ‘Hey, this is your dream girlfriend. She’s down to go to all your baseball games, you know?’ The fans like that,” he said. The “Bryce” character that Adams presents to her fans, “We’ve all always looked at it as if it’s an amalgam of all of us here. It’s not actually her.”

The pool is a short walk from the company's main office and the employee parking lot.

‘What the hell are we looking at?’

The sprawling main house on “the farm,” which they bought with a mortgage last year, is still mostly unfurnished, largely due to their all-consuming schedules. There is a guest room with tripods and ring lights for shooting sex scenes and an office where Adams chats with her “VIPs,” who pay $30 a month. One unused room has been claimed by their cats.

The house is sprinkled with mementos of the couple growing up and falling in love in Florida, including thousands of chunks of sea glass they’d gathered over hours-long walks on the sand. They also own 15 guns, including a .22-caliber long rifle and a pink pistol they keep in the mudroom and take on late-night walks; wild hogs are common here and legal to hunt year-round.

Adams’s mom, a former substitute teacher, comes over twice a week to tidy up the house and fix up the flower beds for $25 an hour. Last Father’s Day, Adams told her parents and younger sister, a doctor who just had her first child, that the “new business in the content space” she’d told them about was actually OnlyFans. She’d intended to tell them at breakfast but got too nervous, then called them all later that day.

Her sister was supportive but didn’t say much, she said. Her parents, who had expected she would grow up to be an architect, nevertheless encouraged her to do whatever makes her happy.

A neon OnlyFans sign hangs over the chat team's loft. The couple keep collections of sea glass they gathered from years of walks on the beach.

“The world has changed so much … but she’s an adult. She has to do what makes her wheels move, what she finds fulfilling,” Adams’s mom said. “When you’re a parent, you want to support your child. And that’s what I do.”

The heart of the company is in the backyard, a cavernous office and gym space they built in a barn once used for storing boats. Most of their employees work in this building, including their video editors, social media managers, chatters and advertising staff; an accountant and a few others work remotely.

The team is trained in the basic software of the modern office: Slack for workplace communication, Google Docs for spreadsheets, Trello for managing team projects. Every Monday at 4:15 p.m., Bryce and Brian lead a company meeting where they review all of the content, captions and publishing plans for the week on a big-screen TV. At lunchtime, an assistant brings everyone Chick-fil-A.

The farm is wired with a server closet, two parallel internet connections, a whole-house generator and a battery backup to ensure they’re never offline. They hired an IT guy who moved from Missouri with his wife, an OnlyFans creator herself.

One of the operation’s most subtly critical components is a piece of software known as “the Tool,” which they developed and maintain in-house. The Tool scrapes and compiles every “like” and view on all of Adams’s social network accounts, every OnlyFans “fan action” and transaction, and every text, sext and chat message — more than 20 million lines of text so far.

It houses reams of customer data and a library of preset messages that Adams and her chatters can send to fans, helping to automate their reactions and flirtations — “an 80 percent template for a personalized response,” she said.

Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement

And it’s linked to a searchable database, in which hundreds of sex scenes are described in detail — by price, total sales, participants and general theme — and given a unique “stock keeping unit,” or SKU, much like the scannable codes on a grocery store shelf. If a fan says they like a certain sexual scenario, a team member can instantly surface any relevant scenes for an easy upsell. “Classic inventory chain,” Adams said.

The systemized database is especially handy for the young women of Adams’s chat team, known as the “girlfriends,” who work at a bench of laptops in the gym’s upper loft. The Tool helped “supercharge her messaging, which ended up, like, 3X-ing her output,” Brian said, meaning it tripled.

For efficiency, the chatters use keyboard shortcuts to quickly send common phrases (“I want to know the real you”) and a feature that displays, across a fan’s profile picture, how much he has paid in tips. On a recent day, one girlfriend was talking with “Ryan” (lifetime tip value: $321.60) about a trip he took to Texas while “Kev” ($46.40) was saying he’d travel “any distance” to find his “right person.” One of their longest-paying subscribers has given $10,000 over the years, Adams said.

Keeping men talking is especially important because the chat window is where Adams’s team sends out their mass-message sales promotions, and the girlfriends never really know what to expect. One girlfriend said she’s had as many as four different sexting sessions going at once.

Adams's chatters talk with her fans for $1.50 a minute.

“There’s not 10 minutes that go by that we’re not like: ‘What the hell are we looking at right now?’” said Zoey Hill, a chatter on the team. “But for the most part, it’s kind of just like you’re having a regular conversation with someone until they’re like, ‘Hey, I’m horny.’ And then you give them what they want.”

Adams employs a small team that helps her pay other OnlyFans creators to give away codes fans can use for free short-term trials. The team tracks redemption rates and promotional effectiveness in a voluminous spreadsheet, looking for guys who double up on discount codes, known as “stackers,” as well as bad bets and outright fraud.

After sending other creators’ agents their money over PayPal, Adams’s ad workers send suggestions over the messaging app Telegram on how Bryce should be marketed, depending on the clientele. OnlyFans models whose fans tend to prefer the “girlfriend experience,” for instance, are told to talk up her authenticity: “Bryce is a real, fit girl who wants to get to know you”; “If you’re looking for real, deep and personal connections ….” Creators with a more hardcore fan base, meanwhile, are told to cut to the chase: “300+ sex tapes & counting”; “Bryce doesn’t say no, she’s the most wild, authentic girl you will ever find.”

Avery Leigh, who runs advertising, was working as a server at a local pizza place, saving up for college in hopes of becoming an obstetrician, when a high school friend told her last year that Adams was hiring chatters. Leigh was later promoted to the ads team and, though she’d never touched a spreadsheet before, she now spends 40 hours a week coordinating with agents and managing an ad budget of more than $900,000 a year.

The $18 an hour she makes on the ad team, however, is increasingly dwarfed by the money Leigh makes from her personal OnlyFans account, where she sells sex scenes with her boyfriend for $10 a month. Leigh made $92,000 in gross sales in July, thanks largely to revenue from new fans who found her through Adams or the bikini videos Leigh posts to her 170,000-follower TikTok account. Adams takes 20 percent.

“This is a real job. You dedicate your time to it every single day. You’re always learning, you’re always doing new things,” she said. “I’d never thought I’d be good at business, but learning all these business tactics really empowers you. I have my own LLC; I don’t know any other 20-year-old right now that has their own LLC.”

‘Cult of you’

By most measures, the Bryce Adams content machine is running at extreme efficiency.

The team is meeting all traffic goals, per their internal dashboard, which showed that through the day on a recent Thursday they’d gained 2,221,835 video plays, 19,707 landing-page clicks, 6,372 new OnlyFans subscribers and 9,024 new social-network followers. And to keep in shape, Adams and her boyfriend are abiding by a rigorous daily diet and workout plan: They eat the same Chick-fil-A salad at every lunch, track every calorie and pay a gym assistant to record data on every rep and weight of their exercise.

But the OnlyFans business is competitive, and it does not always feel to the couple like they’ve done enough. Their new personal challenge, they said, is to go viral on the other platforms as often as possible, largely through jokey TikTok clips and bikini videos that don’t give away too much.

In a podcast last year on OnlyFans sales strategies — titled “How to Get More Simps,” using the internet slang for someone who does too much for someone they like — the host told creators this sales-funnel technique was key to helping build the “cult of you”: “Someone’s fascination will become infatuation, which will make you a lot of money.”

Adams’s company has worked to reverse engineer the often-inscrutable art of virality, and Brian now estimates Adams makes about $5,000 in revenue for every million short-form video views she gets on TikTok. Her team has begun ranking each platform by the amount of money they expect they can get from each viewer there, a metric they call “fan lifetime value.” (Subscribers who click through to her from Facebook tend to spend the most, the data show. Facebook declined to comment.)

Rose painted this image of Adams's signature pose. She now works as an OnlyFans creator herself.

Adams reviews a video editor's work before it's published online.

The younger workers said they see the couple as mentors, and the two are constantly reminding them that the job of a creator is not a “lottery ticket” and requires a persistent grind. Whenever one complains about their lack of engagement, Brian said he responds, “When’s the last time you posted 60 different videos, 60 days in a row, on your Instagram Reels?”

But some have taken to it quite naturally. Rayna Rose, 19, was working last year at a hair salon, sweeping floors for $12 an hour, when an old high school classmate who worked with Adams asked whether she wanted to try OnlyFans and make $500 a video.

Rose started making videos and working as a chatter for $18 an hour but recently renegotiated her contract with Adams to focus more on her personal OnlyFans account, where she has nearly 30,000 fans, many of whom pay $10 a month.

One recent evening this summer, Adams was in the farm’s gym when her boyfriend told her he was headed to their guest room to record a collab with Rose, who was wearing a blue bikini top and braided pigtails.

“Go have fun,” Adams told them as they walked away. “Make good content.” The 15-minute video has so far sold more than 1,400 copies and accounted for more than $30,000 in sales.

The women in Adams’s business voice some uncertainty over how long this all can continue. They’ve seen how other creators have struggled and know that, on the internet, nothing lasts: audiences shrink, bodies change, people burn out and move on.

Adams said there may come a time when she wants to spend fewer hours on the work but that she has no plans to change anytime soon. “For as long as OnlyFans is around, Bryce Adams will be there,” she said. “But there may be some point where I have a family and that becomes more of a primary focus than my pages, at least for a little while.”

She and the others worry, too, about how friends and family might react, even though they feel they’ve done nothing worthy of being judged. Rose said she has lost friends due to her “lifestyle,” with one messaging her recently, “Can you imagine how successful you would be if you studied regularly and spent your time wisely?”

The message stung but, in Rose’s eyes, they didn’t understand her at all. She feels, for the first time, like she has a sense of purpose: She wants to be a full-time influencer. She expects to clear $200,000 in earnings this year and is now planning to move out of her parents’ house.

“I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. And now I know,” she said. “I want to be big. I want to be, like, mainstream.”

## Me and My Bosom

This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic, Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.

One day, about two years ago, I looked in the mirror and was shocked to discover that my once-fabulous tits had transmogrified into a bosom. Whereas breasts—those sexy appendages that had gotten me past velvet ropes and bar tabs aplenty in my 20s and 30s—might be sexy and evocative, the bosom, despite its large size, is solely utilitarian, meant for comforting crying children against or storing Kleenex at weddings and funerals.

As she aged, Nora Ephron felt bad about her neck; I could no longer see my neck. Sometime in my 40s, everything above my hips had, you see, been incorporated into the bosom’s new terrain. My head sort of just perched atop my bosom, which sat atop my waist and my still-skinny legs.

I had seen this body before: on my mother, my grandmother, my great-grandmother, and an assortment of aunts and great-aunts. It was a physique typically packaged, in my family at least, with short haircuts, a purse full of peppermint candies, and blousy, beaded tops for “dress occasions.” It was what I’d always considered “Doña Body” and is well documented in generations of family photos of “mature” women seated together, smiling, their ample bosoms lined up in a row. And suddenly, there that body was, in my own mirror.

How could this be? I wondered. I am 46; I am not a doña—certainly not yet. I am not married; I have no children. All of my nieces and nephews are common-law.

Read: The day I got old

Chronologically speaking, of course, the timing for my metamorphosis was about right. My grandmother married at 17, was a mother at 18, and was a grandmother of two by the time she was my age. The story was the same for most of the women in my family—matriarchs of multiple generations all before 50. I had thought that the Doña Body was about a lifestyle. It was hard for me to accept that it was simply a product of the passage of time.

It was so hard to accept, in fact, that I decided to do something about it. Something drastic.

I had never considered getting Botox or fillers. I used anti-aging creams and night masks only haphazardly. And I have a general aversion to doctors and blood and stitches. But the Doña Body was a bridge too far on the aging journey—one that I was not yet willing to cross.

I decided to have a breast reduction.

The chiropractor I was seeing every other week for the back pain that my boobs caused me agreed. A consultation with a plastic surgeon left me even more certain. This was about more than just not looking like a tía. I would get back to running! I could do yoga without smothering myself! I could wear normal bras! I would have a torso again! I signed up on the spot.

I don’t know that the older women in my family were less shocked by the ravages of time than I was. They were simply more accepting that once “the change” began—one of the many euphemisms for menopause that proliferated at the time—their role in society also changed.

I have a distinct memory of my grandmother staring in the mirror, holding the wedding dress she could hardly believe she’d once fit into. For years, my favorite aunt talked about trying to “get her shape back.” All of my aunts taught me early on how to wash my face to avoid wrinkles for as long as I could (hot water, then cold water, no soap) and how to apply face cream (upward motions, always, and don’t forget your neck). But beyond that and a box of Clairol hair color, what else was there really for them to do? These were working-class women in the ’70s and ’80s. Anti-aging technologies were limited by their time and also their class.

Mérida Rúa, an ethnographer at Northwestern University, studies aging among Puerto Ricans in Chicago, some of whom live in state-subsidized senior housing. Across classes, “the women that I interview take such pride in how they look,” she told me. But the working-class women “have to accept aging and the way that they age, because they don’t have the disposable income to do the other things.”

There are, suddenly, so many other things that they could do! Hormone-replacement therapy. Hair-thickening pills. Botox. Juvéderm. Microneedling or laser therapy for facial wrinkles, and something new called Morpheus8 that somehow combines microneedling and laser therapy. You can eliminate your midlife gut with a procedure called Sono Bello; you can get rid of late-life chin wattles with laser Kybella; you can even “rejuvenate” your vagina. Then, of course, there are the far-less-invasive “maintenance” procedures: the creams and the masks and the evolving world of high-tech facials.

I was raised with that very blue-collar outlook—color your grays and accept your fate—but socialized in quite another. I went to college, then into a career planning luxury events for women who could afford to look 10 if not 20 years younger than they were. I became a writer, which means I get invited to readings and book events and a surprising number of parties. I don’t want to look like one of those shiny-faced grandmas trying to be immune to time, but I still live in a world where J.Lo exists. So, long before the breast reduction, I’d been asking myself: What is the right way to age?

Joanna Vargas is an aesthetician and the owner of an eponymous line of skin-care products and spas. Once a month or so, I visit her Fifth Avenue spa, where a soothing and hilarious woman named Kiara goes over my face with a microcurrent wand for 60 minutes.

Vargas says that women tell her all the time, “‘You know, one day I was walking down the street, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw the reflection of an old lady in the window. And then I looked, and I realized that was me.’ And that’s what motivated them to come in.”

But what exactly is it about the old lady that we’re so afraid of?

The women Rúa interviews all say that “as they got older, they became invisible.” They don’t necessarily want to look younger, only to feel that “I have value, I have relevance … You know, you need to look a certain way for people to actually want to pay attention to you.”

Despite the gerontocracy in our government, everyone knows that our culture puts a premium on youth, especially for women. Old people have become more and more isolated as young people move to urban centers to work. Gentrification has transformed once-multigenerational communities into monoliths of young professionals and families. “People just stopped seeing old people around,” Rúa explained to me.

That mindset reached a sort of nadir during the coronavirus pandemic, the photographer Ari Seth Cohen told me: “People just were like, Okay, well, older people are going to die.”

For 15 years, Cohen has been celebrating fabulous older women through his books, documentary films, and social-media account @advancedstyle. Cohen views his project as a political one, designed to combat the invisibility that Rúa spoke about.

Young people seem to fear growing old more than they fear any of the horror-movie bogeymen Hollywood conjures up. What, other than fear, can explain why Gen Z—people ages 13 to 27—spends more on anti-aging skin-care products than any other generation does? It is part of a movement called “prejuvenation” that’s sending 20-somethings to their dermatologists seeking “preventative Botox” injections. The message that we are internalizing at a younger and younger age is that aging itself is bad. Allowing yourself to seem to age? Unacceptable.

This attitude seems no less self-punishing than the diet culture of the ’90s, which, I can attest, was very hard to shake. The difference, of course, is that—through restraint and work and even self-harm—one can remain thin. But age eventually catches up with all of us.

The night before my surgery, feeling perhaps a bit of sadness at losing my identity as a “large-breasted woman,” I took a last look at my breasts in the mirror and—on the advice of a friend—Marie Kondo’ed them. I thanked them for their (purely cosmetic) service, and bid them, in their current iteration, farewell. At the hospital, the surgeon twisted each of my breasts up as if he was about to cut bangs and marked them with a Magic Marker. This was, he explained, a French technique. The anesthesiologist chatted with me about Kim Kardashian on American Horror Story. And then I went under.

The morning after, stuffed though I was with gauze and pads, I felt lighter. My best friend took a picture and sent it to our group chat. “You look 25 years old,” another friend wrote back. I did look younger (though 25 was probably an exaggeration), but as I healed, I realized that I didn’t feel younger. What I really felt was restored—like a classic car that runs well again. My gait has changed; my sense of energy and purpose in my movement has changed—no longer is every sudden movement a back injury waiting to happen. I feel rejuvenated.

To feel younger would be to have this same body and not think it was enough. To feel younger would be to have this same body and compare it, incessantly, with the bodies of others: women I know, models and actresses I don’t. To feel younger would be to have this beautiful, fit body and squander it by living in an endless loop of insecurity and envy and doubt. So losing the bosom might have made me look younger, but I feel—thankfully—a solidly healthy 46. I’ve probably lost 10 pounds of breast weight, but I still carry on my chest all of the experience and losses and victories that add up to what I hope is some measure of wisdom.

From the April 2023 issue: I am 53 years old. I am 36 in my head.

Suddenly, I have a second chance at life with a body I didn’t fully appreciate the first time around. What will I do with my second chance?

Perhaps the greatest irony of the prejuvenation movement is that whereas younger women are more frightened of appearing older, many women in middle age and beyond seem to be finding a new level of comfort with aging. They are helped in no small part by the beauty and staying power of superstars such as Viola Davis, Sandra Bullock, and Gwyneth Paltrow, who talk openly about their age, and by projects like Ari Seth Cohen’s.

The women Cohen highlights tend to be sartorially flashy and unapologetic about their age. “One of the women who’s in my documentaries is in her 90s,” he told me, “and she always just said, ‘I don’t want to look younger. I just want to look the best I can at any age.’” He hates the term anti-aging, which he finds dangerous: “Anti-aging really just means death, when you think about it.”

“As you get older, I think what we’re chasing is more of a feeling,” Joanna Vargas, the aesthetician, said. Women tell her, “I want to feel like I’m happy in this body. In this skin.”

Nina Lorez Collins, the author of the book What Would Virginia Woolf Do?, describes herself as “a little bit of a pioneer in talking about menopause.” She feels that menopause was the great divide in her aging journey. Before that—when she was my age, in fact—the entire aging thing seemed infinitely scary: “Once you’re in menopause, it really does start to get better for, I think, pretty much everyone. Once you figure out how to manage the symptoms and you kind of reckon with the way your looks are changing, I think most people come to a place of acceptance.” You start to realize “how much wiser and calmer you are,” she told me.

Wiser and calmer is the best way I can describe Katie Lee Biegel, a co-host of the cooking show The Kitchen. I’ve known Lee Biegel for a long time, and I asked her what it feels like to age in front of a television camera. Paradoxically, she told me, the older she gets, the less preoccupied she is with the anxieties of appearance. Although she, too, has feared looking “matronly,” she refuses to chase perfection. “I don’t want to work out for an hour and a half a day,” she said. “I just don’t have time for that.”

Both Collins and Lee Biegel—like a lot of women I spoke with on and off the record for this essay—were very open about their past Botox use. “I started getting Botox when I was 35,” Collins told me. “What the fuck was I thinking?” Lee Biegel had gotten Botox fairly regularly pre-pandemic, but when she went back more recently to try a new filler, she walked out with a black eye that lasted for six weeks. Both women, for now, have decided to moisturize and make the best of things.

“Why do we torture ourselves?” Lee Biegel asked me toward the end of our conversation. She said that sometimes she’ll look back at a photo of herself from six months or a year ago and think, “I looked great, but meanwhile, when I took this picture, I was like, That’s disgusting; I look terrible.” We all do it, she said: “Why?”

After about 10 days on the mend, I was cleared to go back to work. It occurred to me, as I was getting dressed for a fundraising benefit for a board I’m on, that this was probably not what the doctor had in mind. I shoved my rejuvenated boobs and my medical-issue compression bra into a dress before making my way to the Brooklyn Public Library, where I immediately found myself being photographed for a media outlet covering the event.

This, if I’m honest, was another reason I’d had the surgery. Yes, my shoulders hurt, but I was also so tired of fretting about my breasts under the gaze of the public eye. Whether this top or that outfit made me look too sexy or too matronly was simply too distracting.

When I left the house that day, I thought I looked great. But when I saw the photo two days later, I found myself, just as Lee Biegel had talked about, picking it apart. Now that my breasts were smaller, my eyes zeroed in on my newly revealed stomach. I wondered why I hadn’t made time to watch a TikTok on how to find “my angles.”

Perhaps this might have been my moment, the beginning of my slippery slope, and no amount of change or modification or injection would ever have been enough to capture the feeling of me “at my best.” But then I got a text from a relative. My favorite aunt—one of the women immortalized in the family photos—had been struggling with cancer and had been moved into hospice care. I was warned that I should get there as soon as possible, and I didn’t give the photo another thought until now.

It was hard to believe, when I saw my aunt lying in bed, as thin as she was, that there had ever been a time when she’d been concerned about her weight. Seeing her bundled under blankets and in her cap, it was hard to believe that she’d ever complained to me about thinning hair or hot flashes. When I kissed her goodbye, I couldn’t help but notice how smooth and soft her face was. Despite the cancer eating at her, in these last moments of her life, she was still so beautiful.

I started out wanting to write an essay about how, with this bevy of choices in front of me, I should age. The answer, I realized, is gratefully.
