There is actually an explanation for my deep knowledge of Playboy centerfold nipples.

In college, a good friend of mine went back home overseas for good without really disposing of any of his things. He just gave me and a few of his other friends copies of his apartment key and told us to have at it (he had filthy rich parents).

He happened to have 5-6 years worth of Playboy magazines. For a girlfriend-less male in his early 20's, this was a gold mine. So, I took all the mags home to begin reading them. After looking at around 20 issues, I experienced the sort of porn mag numbness klangklangston was talking about.

At that point, I begin really looking at the women, and was struck by how homogenous they all looked. Black, brown, white, it didn't matter. The most striking thing were the breasts and nipples. The breasts were all dome shaped and had the large areolas and small or transparent nipples.

Once I began to have experiences with a variety of real women, I noticed that none of their breasts were like the ones in Playboy. In commiserating with my pals, they confirmed that none of their girlfriends had boobs like that too. This made it an even more noticeable phenomenon to me.

These days, I really don't get turned on by Playboy. The air brushing makes the women look like they are in the uncanny valley, and it's frankly a little creepy.

TL;dr- I looked at a lot of Playboys, don't like the fake look of the boobs. Long live real breasts.
