I found a document in the Federal Register that states what the 2024 limits on the raw materials used to make controlled pharmaceuticals is. They take and answer questions from industry groups and constituents. Someone asked what was going to be done to alleviate the shortage. The Feds basically said, "What do you mean shortage? The manufacturers only made 70% of their allotted meds last year."

This was because there was something like a 10% increase in demand that was unanticipated. Pharma companies make however many doses of the meds for 6 months and then have to retool the machines to make other meds. They can't keep retooling the machines over and over. The Feds don't seem to understand this aspect of the manufacturing process.

Finally, the Feds only monitor demand via a once per year report that's filed by each manufacturer. There was a question in the Fed Register document about whether going to a more real time reporting system was in the works. Their response was, "Gee, that sounds like a good idea."

The ASHP, which is the trade association, expects shortages into 2025.

Here are the sites where the shortages can be tracked:
